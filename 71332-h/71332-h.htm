<span class="fs110">PHILOLOGY AND THE ARYANS</span></h3>

<p class="p1b pfs90"><i>Electric.</i> <i>Quality.</i> <i>Garden.</i> <i>Mead.</i> <i>Timber.</i></p>

<p class="drop-capy">If somebody showed us a document which he said
was an unpublished letter of Dr. Johnson’s, and
on reading it through we came across the word “telephone”,
we should be fairly justified in sending him
about his business. The fact that there was no such
thing as a telephone until many years after Johnson’s
death would leave no doubt whatever in our minds
that the letter was not written by him. If we cared
to go farther, we could say with equal certainty that
the letter was written since the beginning of the
nineteenth century, when the telephone was invented.</p>

<p>Now suppose that there had been nothing about
telephones in the letter, but that it had contained an
account of a thunder-storm. If in describing the stillness
just before the storm broke the writer had said
that “the atmosphere was electric”, we could still
be fairly positive that he was not Dr. Johnson. But
this time it would not be because the <em>thing</em> of which
the letter spoke had no existence in Johnson’s day.
No doubt the heavens during a storm a hundred and
fifty years ago were exactly as highly charged with
electricity as they are to-day; but if we look up the
word <i>electric</i> in the <cite>Oxford Dictionary</cite>, we find that in
Johnson’s time it simply was not used in that way.
Thus, in his own dictionary it is defined as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A property in some bodies, whereby when rubbed so as
to grow warm, they draw little bits of paper, or such-like
substances, to them.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The world was only just beginning to connect this
mysterious property of amber with the thunder and
lightning, and however still and heavy the air might
have been, it would have been impossible for the
lexicographer to describe it by that word. Or again,
supposing the letter had said nothing about a storm,
but that it had described a conversation between
Garrick and Goldsmith which was carried on “at high
tension”, we should still have little hesitation in
pronouncing it to be a forgery. The phrase “high
tension”, used of the relation between human beings,
is a metaphor taken from the condition of the space
between two electrically charged bodies. At present
many people who use such a phrase are still half-aware
of its full meaning, but many years hence everybody
may be using it to describe their quarrels and their
nerves without dreaming that it conceals an electrical
metaphor——just as we ourselves speak of a man’s
“disposition” without at all knowing that the
reference is to astrology.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nevertheless by consulting
an historical dictionary it will still be possible to
“date” any passage of literature in which the phrase
occurs. We shall still know for certain that the
passage could not have been written in a time before
certain phenomena of static electricity had become
common knowledge.</p>

<p>Thus, the scientists who discovered the forces of
electricity actually made it possible for the human
beings who came after them to have a slightly different
idea, a slightly fuller consciousness of their relationship
with one another. They made it possible for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
them to speak of the “high tension” between them.
So that the discovery of electricity, besides introducing
several new words (e.g. <i>electricity</i> itself) into our
everyday vocabulary, has altered or added to the
meaning of many older words, such as <i>battery</i>, <i>broadcast</i>,
<i>button</i>, <i>conductor</i>, <i>current</i>, <i>force</i>, <i>magnet</i>, <i>potential</i>,
<i>tension</i>, <i>terminal</i>, <i>wire</i>, and many others.</p>

<p>But apart from the way in which it is used, there
is a little mine of history buried in the word <i>electric</i>
itself. If we look it up in a dictionary we find that
it is derived from a Greek word ‘ēlektron’, which meant
‘amber’. And in this etymology alone anyone who
was completely ignorant of our civilization could
perceive three facts—that at one time English scholars
were acquainted with the language spoken by the
ancient Greeks, that the Greeks did not know of
electricity (for if they had there would have been
nothing to prevent our borrowing their word for it),
and that the idea of electricity has been connected
in men’s minds with amber. Lastly, if we were
completely ignorant of the quality of amber itself, the
fact that ‘ēlektron’ is connected with ‘ēlektōr’, which
means ‘gleaming’ or ‘the beaming sun’, might give
us a faint hint of its nature. These are some of
the many ways in which words may be made to
disgorge the past that is bottled up inside them, as
coal and wine, when we kindle or drink them, yield
up their bottled sunshine.</p>

<p>Now the deduction of information from the presence
or absence of certain words is a common practice
which has been known to critics and historians of
literature, under some such name as “internal
evidence”, for many years. It is from such evidence,
for instance, that we deduce Shakespeare’s ignorance
of the details of Roman civilization. But until a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
years ago—within the memory of men still living—very
little use had been made of language itself, that
is to say, of the historical forms and meanings of
words as interpreters both of the past and of the
workings of men’s minds. It has only just begun
to dawn on us that in our own language alone, not to
speak of its many companions, the past history of
humanity is spread out in an imperishable map, just
as the history of the mineral earth lies embedded in
the layers of its outer crust. But there is this difference
between the record of the rocks and the secrets
which are hidden in language: whereas the former
can only give us a knowledge of outward, dead things—such
as forgotten seas and the bodily shapes of
prehistoric animals and primitive men—language has
preserved for us the inner, living history of man’s
soul. It reveals the evolution of consciousness.</p>

<p>In the common words we use every day the souls
of past races, the thoughts and feelings of individual
men stand around us, not dead, but frozen into their
attitudes like the courtiers in the garden of the
Sleeping Beauty. The more common a word is and
the simpler its meaning, the bolder very likely is the
original thought which it contains and the more
intense the intellectual or poetic effort which went
to its making. Thus, the word <i>quality</i> is used by most
educated people every day of their lives, yet in order
that we should have this simple word Plato had to
make the tremendous effort (it is perhaps the greatest
effort known to man) of turning a vague feeling into
a clear thought. He invented the new word ‘poiotēs’,
‘what-ness’, as we might say, or ‘of-what-kind-ness’
and Cicero translated it by the Latin ‘qualitas’, from
‘qualis’. Language becomes a different thing for us
altogether if we can make ourselves realize, can even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
make ourselves feel how every time the word <i>quality</i>
is used, say upon a label in a shop window, that
creative effort made by Plato comes into play again.
Nor is the acquisition of such a feeling a waste of
time; for once we have made it our own, it circulates
like blood through the whole of the literature and
life about us. It is the kiss which brings the sleeping
courtiers to life.</p>

<p>But in order to excavate the information which is
buried in a word we must have the means to ascertain
its history. Until quite recently (about a hundred
years ago) philology, as an exact science, was still in
its infancy, and words were derived by ingenious
guesswork from all kinds of impossible sources. All
languages were referred to a Hebrew origin, since
Hebrew was the language of the Bible. This was
taken for granted. Since then, however, two new
developments have revolutionized the whole study,
made it accurate, and enormously extended its scope.
During the eighteenth century Sanskrit, the ancient
speech of the Hindoos, began for the first time to
attract the attention of European scholars. In 1767
a French Jesuit named Coeurdoux pointed out certain
resemblances between the European and Sanskrit
languages. In 1786 Sir William Jones described that
language as being</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>of wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek,
more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined
than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity,
both in the roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar,
than could have been produced by accident—so strong
that no philologer could examine all three without
believing them to have sprung from some common
source which, perhaps, no longer exists.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At the time it was no more than a brilliant conjecture,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
but with it the comparative philology of the Aryan
languages may be said to have begun.</p>

<p>Secondly, with the advent of phonology certain
immutable laws were discovered governing the sounds
made by the human throat, and the way in which
these sounds change with the passing of time and
react upon each other when they are knit together
in a spoken word. Henceforward it was possible to
say for certain that, for example, the English word
<i>wit</i> (from the old verb ‘witan’, to know) was not
<em>derived</em> from the Latin ‘videre’, but cognate, or
related, with it. Many words derived from ‘videre’,
such as <i>advice</i>, <i>envy</i>, <i>review</i>, seem at first sight infinitely
farther off from the stem ‘vid-’ than <i>wit</i>, but it was
now possible for scholars to say for certain that a
Latin stem ‘vid’ adopted into English could not
possibly have changed into <i>wit</i>. They could be
equally certain that, if the Romans had <em>borrowed</em> the
Greek word ‘idein’ (to see) into their language, it
could never have changed its form to ‘<i>vid</i>ere’, so that,
innumerable as are the words which Rome borrowed
from Greece, ‘videre’ is not one of them. Thus, it
was clear that such groups of three words as <i>idein</i>,
<i>videre</i>, and <i>wit</i>, or <i>astēr</i>, <i>stella</i>, and <i>star</i>, were not
father, son, and grandson (as is the case, for instance,
with <i>poenē</i>, <i>poena</i>, and <i>penal</i>), but three brothers or
cousins all descended from a common ancestor with
a stem something like ‘weid’ belonging to some other
language. This, put very briefly and with many
omissions, was the contribution made by phonology
to the science of comparative philology.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not altogether insignificant that the
study of that seemingly dull subject—phonology—should
be associated in our minds with one of the
most charming collection of fairy-tales in Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
It is thanks to the labours of Jacob Grimm during
the first half of the last century that we are now able
to reconstruct the remote pasts of words, not, it is
true, with absolute certainty, but with a degree of
it which makes a chapter such as the present one
worth writing. And while Grimm was burrowing into
the rich, loamy soil of German speech and German
folk-lore, another German scholar, Franz Bopp, was
laying the foundations, with the help of this knowledge
and of the results of the study of Sanskrit, of
a genuinely scientific comparative philology. Nor
was it long before less scholarly but more imaginative
minds, such as Max Müller’s, were interpreting the
meaning of their researches to a wider public.</p>

<p>We can imagine the suppressed excitement of the
philologists of that time as they began to discover
in that remote Eastern language, the sacred
language of the Vedic hymns, words such as ‘vid’
(to see), ‘tara’ (a star), ‘sad’ (to sit), ‘bhratar’ (a
brother). For it was not only the evident relation
of Sanskrit to the languages of Europe that was
exciting. Sanskrit, which had preserved the forms
of its words more unchanged than any other Aryan
tongue, threw a brilliant light on the close relations
existing between those other languages themselves.
For instance, although the sisterhood of words such
as the Greek ‘onoma’, Latin ‘nomen’, and <i>name</i>,
had long been suspected, yet there had been no way
of distinguishing such a sisterhood from purely
accidental resemblances like Hebrew ‘gol’, Greek
‘kaleo’, and <i>call</i>, and the connection between
‘brother’ and ‘frater’ was by no means obvious.
But when the older Sanskrit form ‘bhratar’ was
brought to light, the gap between these words was
at once bridged. It could be seen at a glance how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the three of them, <i>brother</i>, <i>bhratar</i>, and <i>frater</i>, had
started from the same original form and diverged
through the years. Gradually all doubt was blown
away, and Sanskrit, the language of a race with whom
Europeans had thought, and for the most part still
think, that they had nothing whatever in common,
stood revealed as an obvious relative of Latin, Greek,
Modern English, and practically all the other languages
of Europe. It seemed, therefore, to follow that our
ancestors and those of the Hindoos were at one time
living together, that our ancestors and theirs were, in
fact, the same.</p>

<p>At first it was thought that Sanskrit itself was the
parent-language from which all the others had derived,
and that the nations of Europe were descended from
a body of Hindoos, some of whom had migrated
westwards. We called ourselves “Aryans” because
the people who had once spoken Sanskrit were known
as “Aryas”, or worshippers of the God of the
Brahmins. But soon the accurate methods of analysis
which philology had now acquired made it plain that
this could not be so. Therefore a still older language
was postulated and called indifferently the Aryan,
the Indo-Germanic, or the Indo-European parent-language.
If there was a language, there must have
been a people who spoke it, and attention was soon
focused on the character, civilization, and whereabouts
in space and time of the people who spoke the lost
Indo-European, or “Aryan” parent-language.</p>

<p>The fascination of this particular branch of philological
research is apparent when we recollect that in
this case, in the case of these remote Eastern ancestors
of ours, philology is almost the only window through
which we can look out on them. In most subsequent
periods of history we have many other ways, besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the study of language, of discovering the outward
circumstances of men’s lives. Historical records,
archaeology, ethnology, folk-lore, art, literature, all
come to our help in considering, say, the ancient
Egyptian civilization; but it is not so with the Aryans.
Here ethnology and archaeology tell us practically
nothing, anthropology a little, and the rest nothing at
all. If we wish to cross the darkness which separates
us from this period we must lay down a little plank
of words and step delicately over it. And in such
romantic circumstances it is hardly surprising that we
should find a veritable army of scholars and philosophers,
both professional and amateur, jostling each
other upon that plank with such vigour that the bridge
and its burden have often seemed in danger of
vanishing quietly together into the abyss.</p>

<p>The central principle upon which philologists have
worked is this, that if a word occurs to-day in a fair
sprinkling of the Aryan languages, then that word
existed in the Aryan parent-language, and therefore
the thing of which it is the label existed in some form
or other in the primitive Aryan civilization. Conversely,
if an object or an idea is found to have a different
name in most of the Aryan languages, it was sometimes
assumed that that object was not known to the
Aryans before their dispersion. But this negative
deduction soon came to be regarded as unsafe, and
there are indeed many reasons why the whole method
is limited and uncertain. For instance, even in one
language it is constantly happening that when a new
thing or a new idea comes into the consciousness of
the community, it is described, not by a new word,
but by the name of the pre-existing object which
most closely resembles it. This is inevitable. We
have to proceed from the known to the unknown in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
language as in life; but language lags behind life and
words change more slowly than things or ideas. When
railways first came in, their rolling-stock consisted of
a string of vehicles resembling the old horse coach so
exactly that it was said later that “the ghost of a
horse stalked in front of the engine”. Although this
is no longer the case, we still call these vehicles
<i>carriages</i> or <i>coaches</i>, and look like continuing to do so.
To take an even more patent example, when a modern
Englishman or American uses the very old Celtic word
<i>car</i>, we all know what he means: yet it would be an
error to deduce from this that the principle of internal
combustion was known in pre-Christian times in Wales,
Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany, and probably Rome (Latin
‘carrus’, a cognate word). Moreover, we can see at
once that the fraction of error is infinitely greater
when we are dealing, not with the development of a
word in one language, but with its history as it
descended from one language to another; for example,
from the hypothetical parent-tongue into the languages
with which we are familiar to-day. Indeed, this kind
of reasoning, if no other evidence were available, would
lead us to conclude that the Greeks were acquainted
with electricity.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, it is not the object of this
little book to put forward theories and discuss the
extent to which they can be proved or disproved by
words. And though it has been interesting to observe
that in some cases—and notably when we are
endeavouring to reconstruct the life and thought of
our Aryan ancestors—our knowledge, such as it is,
is derived very largely from the evidence of words,
yet in these pages, even when that particular period
is being dealt with, the words chosen for description
will by no means necessarily be those which provide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the most conclusive evidence for what is said. A
great deal has been done in quite recent years by
way of collating the results of comparative philology
with those of anthropology, ethnology, comparative
mythology, etc., and reconstructing from the combined
data something of the past history of our own
and other races or cultures. We are concerned here,
not with the way in which those results were arrived
at, but with the results themselves. The reconstruction
itself has been and is being done by scholars;
here the endeavour is rather to make use of their
labours; not to think about the past, as it were, but
to look at it. Consequently the words chosen are not
the most useful ones, but those which are the best
telescopes; for while the nineteenth century spent
itself prodigally in multitudinous endeavours to
know what the past was, it is now possible for us,
by penetrating language with the knowledge thus
accumulated, to feel how the past is.</p>

<p>Who are the Aryans? Where did they come from?
Looking back down the corridors of time from the
particular perspective to which we have attained in
the twentieth century, far away in the past—it may
be in the Stone Age—we seem to be able to perceive
a remarkable phenomenon. At some particular spot
in the vast plains stretching from Eastern Europe to
Central Asia it was as though a fresh spring bubbled
up into the pool of humanity. Whether it represented
the advent of a new “race-type”, what a race-type
exactly is, and how it begins are questions which we
must leave to others to settle. That spring was the
Aryan culture.</p>

<p>Throughout much of Europe and Asia there were
already in existence different civilizations in different
stages of development; such were the Egyptian, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Chaldean, and farther west the great Minoan civilization,
which in its Bronze Age was to ray out an
influence from Crete all over the Aegean world. It
may be that there was something static<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in the very
nature of these pre-Aryan cultures, or it may be that
they were ageing and passing in the natural course of
events; what is certain is that there was something
dynamic, some organic, out-pushing quality in the
waters of this Aryan spring. For these waters spread.
They have been spreading over the world ever since
that time, now quickly, now slowly, down into India
and Persia, north to the Baltic, west over all Europe
and the New World, until in the persons of the three
Aryan explorers, Peary, Amundsen, and Scott, their
waves have licked the poles. It appears to have been
the tendency of the Aryan settler, whether he came
as a conquering invader or as a peaceful immigrant,
to obliterate more than he absorbed of the aboriginal
culture on which he imposed himself. In this the
Celts and Teutons who ages ago overran most of
Europe appear to have resembled the English-speaking
settlers who long afterwards almost annihilated the
North American Indian with his gods and traditions.
It is true that we English owe to this latter pre-Aryan
race the ability to express just that shade of contempt
which is conveyed by the word <i>skunk</i>, also the
charming blend of whimsicality and reprobation
crystallized in <i>mugwump</i>. But such survivals really
only emphasize the extent to which, as the Aryan
waters spread, the pre-Aryan past has been covered
over. The past does indeed live in the language we
speak and in those with which we are familiar, but it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
is the past of the Aryans. If we dig down far enough
into the English language, we reach an old civilization
flourishing somewhere round the banks of the Dnieper;
of what was going on in these islands at that time we
hear scarcely the faintest reverberation.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the ancient inhabitants
of Western Europe as a whole differed from their
Aryan successors in two important customs. They
buried their dead, whereas the Aryans invariably used
cremation; and they were organized in systems of
matriarchies. Aryan culture is patriarchal to its very
foundations. We may patronize our less fortunate
neighbours, but we do not “matronize” them. Yet
faint memories of such strange ways seem to have
lingered on among the Aryans in the widespread legend
of a race of Amazons who once dwelt in the lost
continent of Atlantis, the western land, and in the
rumour of mighty female warriors in pre-Celtic<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Gaul,
while the name of the River Marne (Matrona) is thought
to be another relic of the existence in pre-Aryan Europe
of a race of men who deified their trees and streams,
and hoped, when they died, to be gathered to their
mothers.</p>

<p>With this brief glance at our forgotten predecessors,
we may turn our gaze upon that region near the
banks of the Dnieper whence our own ancestors first
began to expand into the world. And we get a
glimpse of the kind of settlements in which these
pastoral people must have lived in the fact that the
English word <i>garden</i> has grown from the same stem
as the termination <i>-grad</i> in <i>Petrograd</i>, where it means
‘town’, while on the other hand the Dutch for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
<i>garden</i> is ‘tuin.’ We see their villages, family settlements
springing up in an enclosure round the home
of a patriarch. Households are large and cumbersome,
the sons, as they grow up, bring home wives from
different villages, and all live together under the roof
and absolute dominion of the mother and father-in-law.
Both sexes wear <i>zones</i> or loin-cloths, and
probably in addition one simple garment of fur or of
some woven material, which does not altogether hide
their tattooed bodies, adorned with armlets and necklaces
of animals’ teeth, or it may be of shells or amber
beads. It is the business of the women in these
communities, not only to remain faithful to their
husbands on pain of the most appalling penalties,
not only to bring up the children, to keep house, and
to <i>weave</i> and spin, but also to till the fields and look
after the <i>bees</i>, <i>geese</i>, <i>oxen</i>, <i>sows</i>, and such other
animals as may have been domesticated. A hard
enough life, but they have their consolations as they
grow older and become respected as dames. Moreover,
they have a religious cult of their own. In some cases
their imaginations are rich in myth, and they are
looked up to as knowing the secrets of Nature and
possibly of the future itself. It is the men’s business
to make war, hold councils, and hunt—possibly with
horses<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and <i>hounds</i>, both of which animals are at
any rate known to them. The family lives on a kind
of unleavened bread, <i>milk</i>, cheese,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> cooked meats,
vegetables, and some fruits.</p>

<p>There is much brutality. Widows may be expected
to join their husbands in the grave, and old men are
sometimes killed off to make room; nevertheless, life
is not without its friendlier aspect. There is little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
doubt, for instance, that our Aryan ancestors knew
how to get drunk. The liquor, made principally of
honey, with which they sent themselves to bed, appears
to have been fraught with such sweet associations
that no branch of the Aryan family, however far they
went upon their travels, could forget it. The Angles
and Saxons brought this <i>mead</i> into our country, and
the word occurs in Dutch, Icelandic, Danish, Swedish,
German, Irish, Lithuanian, Russian, Greek (‘methu’),
Sanskrit, Zend, and modern Persian. As it threads
its way through this babel of tongues, ringing the
changes on the meanings of ‘honey’, ‘drunkenness’,
and ‘enjoyment’, the little monosyllable seems to
give us a peculiarly intimate peep into the interior
of an Aryan home. Yet the connection of the word
<i>bed</i> with the Latin stem ‘fod-’ (fodio), ‘to dig’, should
prevent us from forming an unduly voluptuous image
of the final stages of this prehistoric pastime. If we
call up before us a roof and walls of wood or wattles,
bounding a dark interior crowded with human beings
and possibly some cattle, lit only by a draughty hole
in the roof—an arrangement which the Teutons were
evidently trying to express when they afterwards
dubbed it a ‘wind’s eye’ or <i>window</i>—we have a
picture which will serve. It is a picture of our
ancestors just before they began to spread out over
the world, and the time is before 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>But the question of the houses in which they lived
takes us farther back still. At some time, probably
before they became acquainted with agricultural modes
of livelihood, the Aryans were living a nomadic
existence. <i>Axle</i>, <i>nave</i>, <i>wheel</i>, <i>yoke</i>, and a common
word for ‘waggon’ have convinced people that they
once moved from place to place in a kind of primitive
caravan, running probably on solid wheels (for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
there is no common word for ‘spoke’). Now the
English word <i>cove</i>, which in its Icelandic form means
‘hut’ and in its Greek form (‘gupē’) a subterranean
dwelling such as that which was inhabited by the
Cyclops, takes us back to a still older form of residence.
Again, <i>wand</i> in English means a ‘slender rod’, but in
German and Dutch it means a ‘wall’, while the
weightier and more solid word <i>timber</i> is connected
with the Greek root ‘dem-’ (demein), ‘to build’, Latin
‘domus’, ‘a house’. In these words we can perhaps
see the most ancient house rising as time goes on
out of a natural cave in the ground to the dignity
of a sort of dug-out with wattled sides and roof—eventually
to the estate of a firm, wooden hut. And
so, behind the picture of our ancestors as they lived
together on the spot from which they finally began
to spread, we can discern another less certain picture
of the very beginnings; of a race, a family perhaps,
or some voluntary collection of men not tied by blood,
who were together in the Stone Age somewhere in
Central Asia. They increase in numbers and power,
and, trekking westwards, live—for how many years
or centuries we cannot tell—as a race of pastoral
nomads, until somewhere in the region of the Dnieper
they pass from the wandering nomad existence to
some more settled life such as that which has been
described.</p>

<p>In addition to the somewhat prosaic words from
which we have attempted to derive information, it is
pleasant to us to think of these ancestors of ours
already uttering to one another in that remote past
great and simple words like <i>fire</i>, <i>night</i>, <i>star</i>, <i>thunder</i>,
and <i>wind</i>, which our children still learn to use as
they grow up. And we must think also how during
all this time the new thing, the force, the spirit which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the Aryans were to bring into the world, must have
been simmering within them. Strengthening their
physique through the generations by stricter notions
of matrimony, working by exogamy upon their blood,
and through that perhaps upon some quality of
brightness and sharpness in their thought, the Aryans
became. And then they began to move. And the
result was the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, the Parthenon frieze,
the Roman Empire, and the Holy Roman Empire—it
was Buddha, Michelangelo, the plays of Shakespeare,
Bach, Goethe—it was Aristotle and Bacon, the vast
modern industrial civilizations of Europe and America,
and the British Empire touching the Antipodes.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">It would be a great mistake to picture the Aryans
setting out in some vast, organized expedition such
as that of the Israelites under Moses. The study of
comparative grammar suggests rather that they spread
outwards from their centre in a series of little rills,
each one, as it flowed, either pushing the rill in front
of it a stage farther on, or flowing through it and
passing beyond. During the first thousand years of
this process we have very little idea of the extent to
which the individual groups of these ever-widening
circles—the different “races” as they were now
beginning to be—were in communication with one
another. After a time, however, we can discern them
pretty sharply divided into two streams, a north-western
and a south-eastern stream. It was the
main stream which flowed north-west, and it carried
along with it the ancestors of the powerful races which
were afterwards to be called Greeks, Italians, Slavs,
Teutons, and Celts. The settlement of the Celts in
Britain and the subsequent arrival first of the Teutonic
Angles and Saxons and then of the Normans, the
movement of the Celts westward to Wales and Ireland,
and the final streaming of their Teutonic successors
right through them and across the Atlantic—all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
are excellent examples of the way in which the
separate rills of the north-western stream have continued
ever since the first central commotion to crawl
and mingle and overlap like the waves of an incoming
tide.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the south-eastern stream flowed past
the Himalayas down into India and Persia, where
their descendants became the Brahmanic Hindoos and
the Zoroastrian Persians of a later date.</p>

<p>That all connection was lost at a very early date
between these two main streams is plain from another
interesting little group of words. These are common
to all the members of the north-western group, but
quite unknown to the south-eastern, and perhaps the
most interesting is <i>mere</i>, the Old English for ‘sea’,
which is still used poetically of inland waters, and in
the word <i>mer</i>maid, while its Latin form ‘mare’ is
equally familiar to most educated Englishmen. From
the distribution of this word among the Aryan nations,
together with similar equations such as <i>fish</i> and <i>piscis</i>,
we can deduce that these two groups of travellers
had already separated before either of them reached
the sea-board.</p>

<p>There is evidence, too, that this north-western
group, comprising as it did the ancestors of the Greeks
and Romans, as well as of the Celts, Teutons, and
Slavs, had reached before it dispersed a new country
of forests, such as must have covered most of Northern
and Western Europe at that time. At any rate we
find words for trees—such as <i>beech</i>, <i>elm</i>, and <i>hazel</i>—and
for birds—<i>finch</i>, <i>starling</i>, <i>swallow</i>, <i>throstle</i>—common
to most of the languages spoken by their
descendants, yet absent from Persian and Sanskrit.
It was at this time, and amid these surroundings,
that agriculture seems to have appeared among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
north-western Aryans. The old Aryan word from
which we have <i>acre</i> lost its former meaning of ‘any
enclosed piece of land’ and acquired the new and
special significance of <i>tilled</i> land, as in the Latin
‘ager,’ etc. <i>Corn</i>, <i>furrow</i>, <i>bean</i>, <i>meal</i>, <i>ear</i> of corn, and
the verb to <i>mow</i> also date back to this period of our
history.</p>

<p>And then the north-western stream again subdivided;
and we will follow first of all that branch of
it which dropped away southward into the Balkan
peninsula and the islands of the Aegean. This time
it is not a word, but a poet’s imagination which has
fixed for us in a passage of considerable beauty the
historic moment when this wave first lapped the farther
shore, the prophetic shock of contact between Aryan
settler and aborigine:</p>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The young light-hearted Masters of the waves....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These young, light-hearted masters were called
Greeks, or Hellenes; they migrated southwards in a
series of waves, the first of which contained two tribes
known as the Achaians and Danaans. These were
followed and overtaken at a later date by the Dorians,
and subsequently again by the Attic Greeks. We
still make use of some of the experiences undergone
by these tribes, and of the characteristics which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
developed, in order to express more exactly our own
inner experiences. Through the channel of words and
myths which have come down to us from that time,
the great poet who sang to the Achaians and Danaans
of the exploits of their ancestors has given us many
metaphors and images—special little reservoirs of
feeling which we could not have created for ourselves.
Most people, for instance, like to be called <em>Trojans</em>;
<i>stentorian</i> and <i>pander</i> are from the names of characters
in his poems, and <i>nectar</i> and <i>ambrosial</i> from the food
and drink consumed by his gods. Speech was a more
miraculous and rhythmical thing to the Achaians than
it is to us to-day, and whether or no the Gaelic <i>bard</i>
is cognate with the Greek ‘phrazein’, to ‘speak’, there
is no doubt that ‘epos’, the ‘word’, had its other
meaning of ‘poem’. Long afterwards the adjective
‘epikos’ came to be applied especially to lofty compositions
such as those of the great poet himself.
Accordingly, in the European war the special correspondent
could often find no more vivid expression
for his sense of the vastness and grandeur of the
catastrophe he was recording than to call up by the
word <i>epic</i> vague memories of Homer’s gods and heroes.</p>

<p>A single timid reference to ‘awful signs’,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> together
with the absence of any ordinary word for ‘writing’,
suggests that Homer’s Achaians did not know how
to write, and that his two long poems of twenty-four
books each had to be memorized from beginning to
end by that class of professional reciters from which
our word <i>rhapsody</i> is derived. The actual text of
the <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite> gives us a vivid and majestic
picture of early, but not the earliest, Aryan culture.
Of their author, in so far as there was one particular
author, we know very little except that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
probably blind. It was the common thing for the
bards who were to be found among all the Aryan races,
and survived as ‘Minstrels’ into the Middle Ages,
to be blind; and Homer’s own blindness, apart from
a reference to it, has been deduced by some from
a preponderance in his poems of “audile” epithets,
such as the <i>clanging</i> arrow and the <i>loud-sounding</i> sea.
It may be mentioned that the Slavs once called their
bards ‘sliepac’, a word which also meant ‘blind’.</p>

<p>The Dorians who followed soon divided into two
main groups with their centres in Laconia and Attica
respectively. The notorious taciturnity of the inhabitants
of Laconia has given us <i>laconic</i>, and we are
referring to their rigid ideas on infant welfare when
we speak of a ‘<i>spartan</i> mother’, for Sparta was the
capital of Laconia.</p>

<p>But it was in Attica, in the sixth and fifth centuries
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> that the Hellenic culture reached its finest
flower. We use the word <i>Attic</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to describe a peculiarly
finished work of art or an exquisite literary
style. No wonder. In the city state of Athens, for
the first time among the Aryans, there began to grow
up something which an educated man of to-day would
be willing to recognize as a civilization. In that clear
air of a marvellous political freedom—a social atmosphere
which could have condensed from none but
Aryan moral ideas—the matured, age-old wisdom of
Egypt and the East was absorbed by these youngsters
and transformed in a few hundred years into a science,
an art, and a philosophy of their own which have
never been wholly surpassed. Consequently, the
names of many things which we regard as the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
hall-marks of a cultured society can be traced back
to the Attic dialect of this period, and no farther.
<i>Academy</i>, <i>school</i>, <i>history</i>, <i>philosophy</i>, <i>logic</i>, <i>grammar</i>,
<i>poetry</i>, <i>rhythm</i>, <i>harmony</i>, <i>melody</i>, <i>music</i>, are all from
Greek words which were in common use in Athens,
and the lasting influence of her sublime dramatic
tradition is indicated by the great words, <i>chorus</i>,
<i>comedy</i>, <i>drama</i>, <i>theatre</i>, and <i>tragedy</i>, and the lesser
<i>catastrophe</i>, <i>episode</i>, <i>prologue</i>, and <i>protagonist</i>, all of
which draw their meanings from the originality and
inspiration of the great Athenian dramatists.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another branch of the Aryan family had
found its way into Italy, and there, in the eighth
century before our era, had founded the city of Rome.
It is noticeable that the pitch darkness in which the
early doings of all the Aryans are lost often seems to
flash into a spark of myth or legend at those moments
when they come into contact with other races. It is
just such a spark which, in the famous story of the
rape of the Sabine women, lights up for us one of
the early shocks of encounter between these Italiot
Aryans and the older inhabitants of Italy.</p>

<p>Most people know a little about the subsequent
history of these Italiots. The republic which they
founded at Rome transformed itself into an empire
that extended its bounds until they were coterminous
with the civilized world—an empire of Europe and
part of Asia which retained its real authority over
men’s persons until the fifth century A.D., and its
authority, as an idea, over their minds and actions
down to that day at the beginning of the last century
when Bonaparte first styled himself “Emperor of the
French”. There is, in fact, scarcely a word in our
language expressing even remotely the notion of
“authority”, which does not come to us from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Latin: <i>authority</i>, <i>chief</i>, <i>command</i>, <i>control</i>, <i>dictator</i>, <i>dominion</i>,
<i>empire</i>, <i>government</i>, <i>master</i>, <i>officer</i>, <i>rule</i>, <i>subordinate</i>,
are some of them; and it is significant that the
two Greek words which we use to express the same
idea are <i>despot</i> and <i>tyrant</i>. Both these terms have a
definite stigma attaching to them, and are employed
very much more often by the foes of authority than
by her friends. The Greeks were not the nation to
establish a world-empire. They would have combined
to bury Caesar, not to praise him; and from another
point of view the odious <i>sybarite</i> is good proof that they
were not the stuff of which colonists are made. The
English <i>lord</i> and <i>king</i>, on the other hand, retain about
them a hint of the possibility of affection. It is a
mark of affection when sailors drop the Latin <i>captain</i>
and adopt the Dutch <i>skipper</i>, just as it is when
landsmen substitute for Latin <i>manager</i> the Old High
German <i>boss</i>. And lastly, when we wish to suggest
a peculiar blend of dignity and chill self-consciousness,
we use the name of the most remarkable of all
the Roman emperors.</p>

<p>Rome not only extended her jurisdiction over all
Europe; she was responsible for the birth of a new
idea in men’s minds—the idea that “authority”, as
such, based on an abstraction called “law” and
irrespective of real ties of blood or affection, of sympathy
or antipathy, of religion or ownership, can exist
as a relation between human beings.</p>

<p>But we have hurried on to the Empire and left out
the Republic. What were the beginnings and early
occupations of this astonishing race, of whose national
hero we are reminded when we use the word <i>brute</i>?
In the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">previous chapter</a> reference was made to certain
words and phrases which are now used for the purposes
of everyday life, but which were originally technical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
metaphors drawn from the phenomena of electricity.
If we examine such words as <i>calamity</i>, <i>delirious</i>,
<i>emolument</i>, <i>pecuniary</i>, <i>prevaricate</i>, <i>tribulation</i>, we shall
find that they possess a similar history. Although
the Romans of classical times used the Latin words
from which they are derived in much the same way
as the English words are used now, yet if we trace
them a little farther back, we learn that ‘delirare’ had
at one time no other meaning than to ‘go out of the
furrow,’ when ploughing; ‘praevaricari’ was to ‘plough
in crooked lines’; ‘tribulare’ to thrash with a ‘tribulum’,
and so forth. In <i>interval</i>, on the other hand (from
‘intervallum’, the space between two palisades), <i>excel</i>,
<i>premium</i>, <i>salary</i>, and many other words we have
examples of metaphors taken from the military life.
The English-sounding word, <i>spoil</i>, comes to us from
a Latin term which once had no other meaning than
to ‘strip a conquered foe of his arms’. By entering
with our imaginations into the biography of such a
word, as it lives in time, we catch glimpses of civilization
in primitive Rome. Agriculture and war, we feel,
were the primary businesses of life, and it was to
these that the Roman mind instinctively flew when
it was casting about for some means of expressing a
new abstract idea—of realizing the unknown in terms
of the known. Not often could the warlike city afford
to beat her swords into ploughshares, but she was
constantly melting both implements into ideas.</p>

<p>Wherever we turn in our language, we have only
to scratch the surface in order to come upon fresh
traces of Rome and of her solid, concrete achievements
in the world. With Greece, however, it is different.
It was not the outer fabric of a future European
civilization which the Greeks were building up while
their own civilization flourished, but the shadowy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
inner world of human consciousness. They were
creating our outlook. We shall see a little later how
the language which is used by the theologians,
philosophers, and scientists of Europe was the gradual
and painful creation of the thinkers of ancient Greece;
and we shall see that, without that language, the
thoughts and feelings and impulses which it expresses
could have no being. Rome’s task was to erect across
Europe a rigid and durable framework on which the
complicated texture of thought, feeling, and will,
woven in the looms of Athens and Alexandria, could
be permanently outspread. Yet the performance of
this task, concrete as it was, was inseparably connected
with an event of tremendous import for that
growing, inner world to which we have already
referred—the most significant event, as many believe,
in the whole history of mankind.</p>

<p>The first casual contact between Greek coaster and
Semitic trader, imaginatively portrayed in the stanza
quoted above from Matthew Arnold, was indeed
prophetic. It proved afterwards to have been not
merely a memorable event, but a sort of fertilization
of the whole history of humanity. For to one Semitic
tribe the passionate inner world of its thoughts and
feelings had remained almost more real than the
outward one of matter and energy. The language
of the Old Testament is alone enough to tell us that,
while the Greek Aryans had been pouring their vigour
into the creation of intellectual wisdom and liberty,
the Hebrews had been building up within themselves
an extraordinary moral and emotional life, as narrow
as it was intense. The two streams of evolution,
stronger for having been kept apart, were destined to
meet and intermingle. In 332 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when Alexander
the Great sacked Sidon and Tyre, Aryans and Semites<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
began for the first time to live side by side. They did
not intermarry, but subtle influences must have passed
from one to the other, for in Alexandria, shortly
afterwards, contact between the two grew so intimate
that by the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Greek had become
the official language of the Hebrew Scriptures. In
the same century a Roman Protectorate was established
over Syria, which in due course of time became a
province of the Roman Empire. In that province
was born the individual who is known to history as
Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>His teaching, as far as it has come down to us,
was Semitic both in its form and in its outlook on the
past. Nevertheless, it was His teaching, and the
feelings and impulses (though in a somewhat unrecognizable
form) which He implanted in the hearts and
wills of men, which were spread by the organization
of the Roman Empire all over Europe; and it was,
above all, that part of the Greek world of thought
which had crystallized round His teaching that was
carried over into the thought and feeling of modern
Europe.</p>

<p>But all this could only happen very slowly; for
while Greece and Rome had been rising successively
to pinnacles of civilization, the rest of the north-western
group of Aryans had remained plunged in
darkness. They had passed Italy by, and already,
more than a thousand years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, begun to spread
themselves over the rest of Europe and to develop
in the different areas wherein they found a final resting-place
the distinctive characteristics of Teuton, Slav,
and Celt. The Slavs, although they occupied—and
still occupy—the whole vast east of Europe, and
although they number something like two hundred
million souls have as yet had extraordinarily little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
influence upon our national life. There are only
two Slavonic words which may be described as
common in all our language, <i>trumpet</i> and <i>slave</i>, and
both have come to us by devious routes, the first
through German and French, the second through
Greek and Latin. One of the lesser Slavonic races,
the Croatians, developed a kind of neckwear which
appealed to the fashionable French, who adopted it
and described it as ‘croate’, ‘crovate’, or ‘cravate’,
from which we get our <i>cravat</i>. Otherwise the words
are mostly exotic both in sound and meaning. Thus,
those that come to us direct from Russia are <i>copek</i>,
<i>drosky</i>, <i>knout</i>, <i>rouble</i>, <i>samovar</i>, <i>steppe</i>, <i>verst</i>—all of
which, with the possible exception of <i>steppe</i>, are still
only used when we are speaking of life in Russia itself.</p>

<p>How different it is when we come to consider the
Teutons! When we have abstracted all the Latin
words, the French words, the Celtic words, etc., from
our vocabulary, the “English” words which remain
are all Teutonic; for we, ourselves, are a branch of
the Teutonic race.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Accordingly some of our older and
most English words contain buried vestiges of the
lives which our ancestors once lived in the continental
forests. <i>Fear</i>, which is thought to be derived from
the same word as <i>fare</i>, has been taken to suggest the
dangers, and <i>weary</i>, which is traced to an old verb
meaning ‘to tramp over wet ground’, the fatigues
of early travel, while <i>learn</i> goes back to a root which
meant ‘to follow a track’. As the Italiot Aryans,
the Romans, created and extended their great empire,
they came into contact with these barbaric Teutonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
tribes, whom they regarded, naturally enough, not as
kinsmen, but as strangers. We find some of the results
of this contact in such words as <i>inch</i>, <i>kitchen</i>, <i>mile</i>, <i>mill</i>,
<i>pound</i>, <i>street</i>, <i>toll</i>, <i>wall</i>, and <i>table</i>—all of which are
Latin words borrowed by our ancestors while they
were still living on the Continent together with the
ancestors of the Scandinavian, Dutch, German,
Austrian, and Swiss nations. By their nature these
words suggest civilizing influences, and we find in their
company the names of more portable articles, such
as <i>chest</i>, <i>dish</i>, <i>kettle</i>, <i>pillow</i>, and <i>wine</i>, which traders
might have brought with them on their beasts of
burden. This hypothesis becomes almost a certainty
when it is seen that <i>mule</i> and <i>ass</i> were borrowed from
Latin at this time; that <i>-monger</i> (in <i>costermonger</i>, <i>fishmonger</i>,
...) is a corruption of ‘mango’, the Latin
name for a trader; and that the old English <i>ceapian</i>,
‘to buy’, which we still keep in <i>chap</i>, <i>chapman</i>,
<i>cheap</i>, ... goes back to ‘caupones’, the Roman name
for wine-dealers. A few words like <i>pepper</i> even seem
to have come in at this time from the remote East,
by way of Rome, and altogether these old Teutonic
words may indeed give us, as Mr. Pearsall Smith has
said, “a dim picture of Roman traders, travelling
with their mules and asses along the paved roads of
the German provinces, their chests and boxes and wine-sacks,
and their profitable bargains with our primitive
ancestors”. Finally, the military words <i>camp</i> and <i>pile</i>
recall the heyday of the Empire, when Rome would
recruit vast armies from her provincial subjects; and
even <i>church</i> (another word common to all the Teutonic
languages) may have been brought home by German
mercenaries on service in the East. The Greek
‘Kuriakon’, from which it is said to be derived, was
in use in the Eastern provinces, as opposed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
‘ecclesia’ (French ‘église’, Italian ‘chiesa’ and
<i>ecclesiastical</i>) of Latin Christianity, and our pagan
forefathers probably picked it up accidentally while
they were pillaging the sacred buildings in which their
posterity was to kneel.</p>

<p>The modern nations of Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland, England, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland
cover most of the area over which the Teutonic
immigrants originally spread. In a good many cases
they found Celtic predecessors already in possession.
These Celts had been the first Aryans to arrive in
Northern Europe, and they seem, at one time, to have
spread over most of the Continent. Later on, in
historical times, they were to be found chiefly throughout
that wide district—including most of modern
France and a great part of Spain and Portugal—which
the Romans called “Gaul”, as well as all over Great
Britain and Ireland. In Spain and France they
mingled their blood extensively with that of the
Italiots, the two together becoming the ancestors of
the present “Latin” races or speakers of the
“Romance”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> languages. But already, long before
the decline of the Roman Empire, the Teutons were
beginning to drive the Celts westward and away, a
process which is clearly marked in these islands by
the prevalence of Celtic place-names in the west
country. Thus, the percentage of Celtic place-names
in Cornwall has been calculated to be about 80; in
Devon it is only 32, and in Suffolk 2. The conflict
between Celt and Teuton dragged on in Ireland until
1921, and it is doubtful if it is quite finished yet.
One contingent of the old Celtic inhabitants of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
island, or <i>Britons</i>, driven to the tip of Cornwall, decided
to leave these shores altogether. They sailed back to
the Continent, and there established themselves in
the sea-board district which still bears the name of
<i>Brittany</i>. It is said that a Welsh peasant and a Breton
can still, to this day, understand one another’s speech
well enough for most practical purposes.</p>

<p>The number of proved Celtic words which have
found their way into English is extraordinarily small—scarce
above a dozen. <i>Bard</i>, <i>bog</i>, and <i>glen</i> are
among those which have come to us direct, and <i>car</i>
had to travel through Latin and French before it
reached us, the original having been borrowed by
Julius Caesar from the Gauls, who had thus named
their war chariots. But for the most part, Celtic
words like <i>banshee</i>, <i>eisteddfod</i>, <i>galore</i>, <i>mavourneen</i>, ...
have a remote and foreign look, even though we may
have used them for many years. When we reflect that
the Welsh tongue is still spoken within two hundred
miles of London, and that another Celtic language,
the Cornish, has only just died out, this seems very
difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Such, then, in barest outline, was the distribution
of the Aryan races which formed the major part of
that vague and loose-knit organization, the later Roman
Empire. But it must not be imagined that this
picture of Rome’s European subjects is anything like
complete. Evoking history from words is like looking
back at our own past through memory; we see it, as
it were, from within. Something has stimulated the
memory—a smell, a taste, or a fragment of melody—and
an inner light is kindled, but we cannot tell how
far that light will throw its beams. Language, like the
memory, is not an automatic diary; and it selects incidents
for preservation, not so much according to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
intrinsic significance as according to the impression they
happen to have made upon the national consciousness.</p>

<p>Thus, English words have little to tell us about the
great migrations and massacres in Europe during the
first ten centuries of the Christian era, for terms of
abuse like <i>vandal</i> and <i>hun</i> draw their emotional force
from the imaginations of historians rather than from
actual contact with the tribes in question.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> From
a mathematically impartial point of view, therefore,
the small amount of space that can be assigned here
to events which absorbed such an enormous share of
time and energy and swallowed millions of human
lives is indeed misleading. There is, however, an
interesting little group of words still bearing the
imprint of the mighty upheaval which took place
around the Mediterranean during the seventh and
eighth centuries <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, when Mohammedan Arabs
overran Persia, Syria, Egypt, North Africa, Spain,
and the south of France. As might be expected,
these words come to us mostly from Arabic, via
Spanish and French, for it was in Spain that Islam
took her firmest hold on Europe. They include <i>cotton</i>,
<i>gazelle</i>, <i>giraffe</i>, <i>lacquey</i>, <i>masquerade</i>, <i>syrup</i>, <i>tabby</i>
(originally a kind of silk), <i>tabor</i>, <i>talc</i>, <i>tambourine</i>, and
some very interesting technical terms to which we shall
presently return. Naturally the receding tide of invasion
has left Arabic place-names dotted about in all the
countries mentioned, while Spain herself is literally
crammed with them; but to give examples would be
beyond the scope of this little volume, which now
finds itself drawn by the laws of its subject-matter to
hover more closely about the shores of these islands.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">There could hardly be a better example of the
uneasy movement of Aryan migrations than the
history of the settlement of the British Isles. We
find them, first of all, as far back as we can look,
inhabited by an unknown population who left their
barrows and tumuli dotted about the country, whose
society seems to have been matriarchally organized,
and who, if the name <i>Pict</i> may be taken as any
indication, probably had the habit of painting or
tattooing their bodies. At length, several centuries
before our era, the first Aryan wave reaches these
shores in the persons of the Celts, who spread over
England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, where they
have been pointed out and variously described by
historians as <i>Britons</i>, <i>Ancient Britons</i>, <i>Welsh</i>, <i>Gaels</i>,
<i>Celts</i>,... They settle down and live for some
centuries the primitive life of savages, till half-way
through the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> they are disturbed by
a little Aryan tongue reaching out from the <ins class="corr" id="tn-35" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'wellnigh spent'">
well-nigh spent</ins> Italian wave. Pagan Rome establishes a brief
dominion over a small portion of Britain, drives roads,
builds camps and cities, and after some four hundred
years is sucked back again to the Continent. Another
century, and the Angles and Saxons, borne forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
on the crest of the Teutonic wave, overrun the main
island, driving the Celts into its extremities, whence
they regurgitate, before finally settling down, upon
various military and missionary enterprises which have
played an important part in our history. But already
another ripple of the Teutonic wave is upon us, rocking
over the seas in the long boats of the Scandinavian
Vikings, and almost before they have left their impress
on the eastern quarter of the land, a third—the
Normans this time—is breaking on Britain once again
at Pevensey. The liquid metaphor is unavoidable,
for no other image seems adequate to express what
actually happened. To watch through the glasses of
history the gradual arrival and settlement of the
Aryans in this country is to be reminded irresistibly
of the rhythmic wash and backwash, the little
accidental interplays of splash and ripple, which
accompany the tide as it fills an irregularly shaped
pool.</p>

<p>Every one of these motions has left its mark on our
language, though the traces of the earliest immigration
of all—that of the Celts—are rather scarce. The
clearest vestiges of it are to be found in the proper
names of our rivers, for a surprising number of these
contain one or other of the various Celtic terms for
‘water’ or ‘river’, e.g. <i>avon</i>, <i>dwr</i> (<i>ter</i> or <i>der</i>), <i>uisge</i>
(<i>wye</i>, <i>usk</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>ax</i>), while the other parts of the name
are often composed of words for ‘water’ taken from
another Aryan language, as in <i>Derwentwater</i>, <i>Windermere</i>,
<i>Easeburn</i>, <i>Ashbourne</i>,... An ingenious theory
has been evolved to account for this. In the case of
the <i>Dur-beck</i> in Nottinghamshire, and the <i>Dur-bach</i>
in Germany, it has been supposed that in the first
place a body of Celtic immigrants squatted by the
side of a stream which, as they were not extensive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
travellers, they knew simply as the <i>dwr</i>—‘The Water’.
Their Teutonic successors inquired the name of the
stream, and on learning that it was <i>dwr</i>, naturally
assumed that this was a proper name. They accordingly
adopted it, and tacked on one of their own words
for ‘water’—‘bach’ or ‘beck’, just as we may speak
of the ‘Avon River’ or the ‘River Ouse’. The phenomenon
occurs so persistently both in this country and
all over Europe that this explanation can hardly be
altogether fanciful.</p>

<p>The four hundred years of Roman colonization,
following Julius Caesar’s landing in 55 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>—years
which left such permanent and conspicuous vestiges
on the face of England—have made little enough
impression on her language. Fresh as the memory
of that civilization must have been when the Angles
and Saxons arrived, they seem to have learnt nothing
from it. A few towns, such as <i>York</i> (Eboracum),
retain in a more or less corrupted form the particular
titles given to them by their Roman founders, but
outside these almost the only Latin words which our
ancestors can be proved to have taken from the
Britons are <i>port</i> and ‘castra’ (a camp), surviving
to-day in <i>Chester</i> and in the ending of many other town
names such as <i>Winchester</i>, <i>Lancaster</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>,...</p>

<p>Then, during the fifth and sixth centuries of our
era the Angles and Saxons began to flow in from the
Continent, bringing with them old Aryan words like
<i>dew</i>, <i>night</i>, <i>star</i>, and <i>wind</i>, which they had never
forgotten, new words which they had coined or
developed in their wanderings, and Latin words
which they had learnt as provincial subjects of
the Roman Empire,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> bringing, in fact, that peculiar
Teutonic variant of the Aryan tongue which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
forms the rich nucleus of our English vocabulary.
Their arrival here was followed almost immediately
by their conversion to Christianity; and this moment
in our history was a pregnant one for the future of
Europe. For now the two great streams of humanity—Teutonic
blood from the one side, and from the other
the old classical civilization, bearing in its dark womb
the strange, new Christian impulse—met. The Latin
and Greek words which entered our language at this
period are concerned for the most part with the dogma
and ritual of the Church; such are <i>altar</i>, <i>candle</i>, <i>clerk</i>,
<i>creed</i>, <i>deacon</i>, <i>hymn</i>, <i>martyr</i>, <i>mass</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>priest</i>, <i>psalm</i>,
<i>shrine</i>, <i>stole</i>, <i>temple</i>, and many others. Far more
important was the alteration which now gradually took
place in the <i>meanings</i> of many old Teutonic words—words
like <i>heaven</i>, which had hitherto denoted a
‘canopy’, or <i>bless</i>, which had meant to ‘consecrate
with blood’. But to this we must return later, when
we come to consider what is called the “semantic”
history of English words—that is to say, the history
of their meanings.</p>

<p>Although Christianity did not come officially from
Rome to England until Augustine landed in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 597, it
had already found its way here indirectly during the
Roman occupation. Obliterated by the pagan Anglo-Saxons,
it had continued to flourish in Ireland, and
the actual conversion of most of the English is
believed to have been the work of Celtic Christians,
who returned from Ireland and established missionary
bases in Scotland and Northumbria. Their influence
was so extensive that ‘Scotia’, the old name for
Ireland, came to be applied to the country which we
still know as <i>Scotland</i>. <i>Pat</i> and <i>Taffy</i>, the popular
nicknames for an Irishman and a Welshman, are
descended from the Celtic saints, Patrick and David,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
and it is interesting to reflect that the Celtic missionaries
were starting their work in Northumbria at
almost exactly the same moment as St. Augustine
landed in Kent. Thus Christianity enfiladed England,
as it were, from both ends; and while the southern
Anglo-Saxons were learning the Greek and Latin words
to which we have referred, the Irish Christians in the
north had been making the language a present of
a few Celtic words, two of which—<i>druid</i> and <i>lough</i>—have
survived. Again, although the name for the
instrument of the Passion comes to us ultimately from
the Latin ‘crux’, yet the actual form which the word
<i>cross</i> has taken in our language is very largely due
to these Irish Christians. But for them it would
probably have been something like <i>cruke</i>, or <i>cruce</i>,
or <i>crose</i>. This word has an interesting history. It
was adopted from the old Irish ‘cros’ by the
Northmen, and it is due to them that the final “s”
took on that hissing sound which is represented in
modern spelling by “ss”. We may suppose, therefore,
that but for the Irish Christians the word would have
been something like <i>cruce</i>, and but for the Northmen
it might have been <i>croz</i> or <i>croy</i>.</p>

<p>In the ninth and tenth centuries these Northmen,
the Scandinavian Teutons, whom our ancestors called
Danes, established an ascendancy over a large part
of England. They seem to have mingled easily with
the English, and we can trace back to their dialect
some of the very commonest features of our language.
Thus, the Scandinavian pronouns, <i>they</i>, <i>them</i>, <i>their</i>,
<i>she</i>, gradually replaced less convenient Anglo-Saxon
forms, and it is to the Northmen that we owe that
extremely useful grammatical achievement which has
enabled us to form both the genitive and the plural
of nearly <i>all</i> nouns by merely adding the letter “s”.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Other Scandinavian words are <i>call</i>, <i>get</i>, <i>hit</i>, <i>husband</i>,
<i>knife</i>, <i>leg</i>, <i>odd</i>, <i>same</i>, <i>skin</i>, <i>take</i>, <i>want</i>, <i>wrong</i>; and there
are many more hardly less common. The mighty word
<i>law</i>, together with <i>outlaw</i>, <i>hustings</i>, <i>wapentake</i>, <i>moot</i>,
and <i>riding</i> (division of Yorkshire) serve to remind us
that the Danish ascendancy was no hugger-mugger
affair, but a firm political organization. The old
Anglo-Saxon words which these Northern intruders
replaced, such as <i>niman</i>, ‘to take’, and <i>Rood</i> (the
Cross) have mostly fallen out of use; but in some
cases the two words survive side by side. Thus, our
useful distinction between <i>law</i> and <i>right</i> was once
geographical rather than semantic, the two words
covering roughly the eastern and the western halves
of England.</p>

<p>And now there followed an event which has had
more influence on the character of the English language
than any other before or since. The conquest of
England by the Norman<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> invaders brought about an
influx of French words which went on increasing in
volume for more than three centuries. At first it was
little more than a trickle. For a long time the
Norman conquerors did not mix much with their
Saxon subjects. There are plenty of indications of this;
for the languages, too, moved side by side in parallel
channels. The custom of having one name for a live
beast grazing in the field and another for the same
beast, when it is killed and cooked, is often supposed
to be due to our English squeamishness and hypocrisy.
Whether or no the survival of this custom through
ten centuries is due to the national characteristics in
question it would be hard to say, but they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
certainly nothing to do with its origin. That is a
much more blameless affair. For the Saxon neatherd
who had spent a hard day tending his <i>oxen</i>, <i>sheep</i>,
<i>calves</i>, and <i>swine</i>, probably saw little enough of the
<i>beef</i>, <i>mutton</i>, <i>veal</i>, <i>pork</i>, and <i>bacon</i>, which were
gobbled at night by his Norman masters. There is
something a little pathetic, too, in the thought that
the homely old word, <i>stool</i>, could be used to express
any kind of seat, however magnificent, until it was,
so to speak, hustled into the kitchen by the smart
French <i>chair</i>. Even the polite, however, continued to
use the old word in the idiom “to fall between two
stools.” <i>Master</i>, <i>servant</i>, <i>butler</i>, <i>buttery</i>, <i>parlour</i>, <i>dinner</i>,
<i>supper</i>, and <i>banquet</i> all came over with William,
besides the names of our titular ranks, such as <i>duke</i>,
<i>marquis</i>, <i>viscount</i>, <i>baron</i>, and <i>countess</i>. The French
word ‘comte’ was evidently considered to be
equivalent to the one existing Anglo-Saxon title, <i>earl</i>,
with the result that <i>count</i> never became an English
rank. But since it had not been the Saxon custom
to give ladies titles corresponding to those of their
lords, the word <i>countess</i> was able to fill an important
gap. That the Feudal System had an educative value
and played its part in creating modern ideals of
conduct is suggested by such words as <i>honest</i>, <i>kind</i>,
and <i>gentle</i>, which meant at first simply ‘of good
birth or position’ and only acquired during the
Middle Ages their later and lovelier meanings.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting of the words that must
have come over from France about this time are such
courtly flower-names as <i>dandelion</i> and <i>pansy</i>, from
‘<span lang="fr">dent-de-lion</span>’ (describing the ragged leaves) and the
sentimental ‘pensée’—remembrance. Many of these
early Norman words seem to have a distinctive
character of their own, and even now, after nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
a thousand years, they will sometimes stand out from
the printed page with peculiar appeal. Perhaps this
is especially true of the military vocabulary. That
sharp little brightness, as of a window-pane flashing
just after sunset, which belongs to the ancient, technical
language of heraldry, such as <i>argent</i>, <i>azure</i>, <i>gules</i>, ...
sometimes seems to have spread to more common
Norman words—<i>banner</i>, <i>hauberk</i>, <i>lance</i>, <i>pennon</i>, ...
and—in the right mood—we can even catch a gleam
of it in everyday terms like <i>arms</i>, <i>assault</i>, <i>battle</i>,
<i>fortress</i>, <i>harness</i>, <i>siege</i>, <i>standard</i>, <i>tower</i>, and <i>war</i>. The
Norman-French etymology of <i>curfew</i> (couvre-feu) is
too well known to require comment.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that nearly all these words are
directly descended from the Latin, <i>beef</i> going back
through ‘boeuf’ to ‘bov-em’, <i>master</i> to ‘magister’,
<i>duke</i> to ‘dux’,... Thus already, by the thirteenth
century, we can trace in our vocabulary four distinct
layers of Latin words. There are the Latin words
learnt by our ancestors while they were still on the
Continent, such as <i>camp</i>, <i>mile</i>, and <i>street</i>;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> there
are the Latin words brought over by the Roman
invaders, of which <i>port</i> and <i>Chester</i> were given as surviving
examples; and thirdly there are those words—<i>altar</i>,
<i>candle</i>, <i>nun</i>, ... brought over by the Christian
missionaries as described earlier in this chapter.
These three classes are reckoned to account for about
four hundred Latin words altogether; and lastly
there is this great deposit of Norman-French words,
of which the number must have been running into
thousands. For it was not only terms of general
utility which were transferred from one language to
another. A second and entirely different kind of
borrowing now sprang up—the literary kind. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
two or three centuries Poetry and Romance had been
making rapid strides in Italy and France. The
medieval habit of writing only in Latin was dying out
and Dante in Italy and Du Bellay in France had both
written treatises extolling the beauties of their native
tongues. French lyric poetry burst into its early
spring blossom among the troubadours, with their
curious “Rose” tradition, and for two hundred years
the English poets imitated and translated them as
fast as ever they could. It was just at the end of
this long period of receptiveness that an event occurred
which fixed the ingredients of our language in a way
they had never been fixed before. The printing press
was invented.</p>

<p>A modern poet, looking back on that time, can
scarcely help envying a writer like Chaucer with this
enormous store of fresh, unspoilt English words ready
to his hand and an unlimited treasury across the
channel from which he could pick a brand-new one
whenever he wanted it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast <i>deserved</i> sorer for to smart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But <i>pitee</i> renneth soone in <i>gentil</i> heart.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here are three Norman-French borrowings, three
fine English words with the dew still on them,
in two lines. It was the May morning of English
poesy.</p>

<p>For these were not “French” words. Right at the
beginning of the thirteenth century the English kings
had abandoned Normandy, and the English Normans,
separated from their brethren, began to blend more
and more completely with their neighbours. In
England French remained at first the exclusive language
of the Court and the law, but, as the blood of
the two peoples mingled, the Norman words which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
were not dropped gradually altered their shapes,
developing various English characteristics, which not
only differentiated from their original French forms
the words already in the language, but served as
permanent moulds into which new borrowings could
be poured as they were made. <i>Gentil</i> changed to <i>gentle</i>,
<i>pitee</i> to <i>pitie</i> or <i>pity</i>; and it was the same with
innumerable others. Familiar French-English terminations
like <i>-tion</i>, <i>-ty</i>, <i>-ance</i>, <i>-age</i>, <i>-able</i>, <i>-on</i>, were already
nearly as common in Chaucer as they are in the pages
of an average modern writer. Begotten on Latin
words by generations of happy-go-lucky French and
English lips, they were fixed for ever by the printing
press, and to-day, if we want to borrow a word
directly from Latin, we still give it a shape which
tacitly assumes that it came to us through the French
language at about that time. As Nature takes the
human embryo through repetitions of its discarded
forms—fish, reptile, mammal, and vertebrate—before
bringing it to birth, so whoever introduced, let us
say, the word <i>heredity</i> in the nineteenth century
went through the instinctive process of deriving from
the Latin ‘hereditare’ an imaginary French word,
‘heredité’, and converting the latter into <i>heredity</i>. It
is usually done when we wish to borrow a new word
from Latin.</p>

<p>We have borrowed so many that it has lately been
calculated that as many as one-fourth of the words
which we can find in a full-sized Latin dictionary
have found their way directly or indirectly into the
English vocabulary. A large number of these are
Greek words which the Romans had taken from them.
Thus, taking into account those Greek words which
have come to us by other channels, Greek and Latin
form a very large and a very important part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
English language. All through the history of our
nation the two threads can be seen running together.
At first sight they appear to be so inextricably twisted
round one another as to form but one solid cord,
but in reality it is not so difficult to unravel them.
The fact, for instance, that <i>hospital</i>, <i>parliament</i>, and
<i>prison</i> are Latin, while <i>church</i> and <i>school</i> have only
come <i>through</i> Latin from the Greek, is symbolical of
the two main divisions into which the classical part
of our language falls; for words which are genuinely
of Latin origin—unless they have been especially used
at some time to translate the thoughts of Greek
writers—are very often concerned with the material
outer world, but words of Greek origin are more likely
to be landmarks in the world of thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>Rome had spent herself in building up the external,
visible framework on which European civilization was
to hang; and this fact, observable in the word-relics
of her military and political exploits, is observable
still more intimately in the character and history of
that great institution, our common law. Dignified
vocables like <i>justice</i>, <i>jurisdiction</i>, <i>jurisprudence</i>, speak
for themselves the lasting influence of the great Roman
conception of ‘jus’—that abstract ideal of the
relation between one free human being and another
in so far as it is expressed in their actions. It is not
that in any sense we took over the Roman system;
lawyers as well as poets are keen to insist that we
built up our own. But as freedom slowly broadened
down from precedent to precedent, there was always
before the early English kings and judges a sort of
pattern—more than that, a vital principle which had
outlived one body and was waiting to be clothed with
another. It was the spirit of Roman law living on
in her language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>A whole chapter might be written on the numerous
English words whose meanings can be traced back
to the usages of Roman law. Take, for instance, the
word <i>person</i>. Derived, probably, from an Etruscan
word meaning an actor’s mask, <i>person</i> was used by
the Roman legislators to describe a man’s personal
rights and duties, which were defined according to his
position in life. Its present meaning of an individual
human being is largely due to the theologians who hit
upon it when they were looking for some term that
would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead
without admitting more than one “substance”.
When we remember for how long a time Latin continued
to be the universal written language of educated
Europe,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the language of history and philosophy as
well as of theology, we can imagine how the subtle
flavour of this word’s former meaning clung to its
syllables through all their ecclesiastical soarings and
was ready, as soon as it came to English earth, to
assist the brains of our early lawyers in their task
of imagining and thus creating that fortunate legal
abstraction, the British subject. ‘Obligatio’ in early
Latin meant merely the physical binding of someone
to something; but in the Roman law of that date a
defaulting debtor was literally bound and delivered
a prisoner into the hands of his creditor. Thus, when
a little later on this crude practice was abandoned,
‘obligatio’ came to mean the duty to pay—a duty
which the creditor could now only enforce against his
debtor’s property; and in this way the general meaning
of our word <i>obligation</i> was developed. Similarly,
retaliation came to us from the Latin ‘<span lang="la">Lex Talionis</span>’,
the latter word being associated with ‘talis’ (such or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
same) and implying a punishment that fits the crime;
while <i>advocate</i>, <i>capital</i>,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> <i>chattel</i>,<a id="FNanchor_15a" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> <i>classical</i>, <i>contract</i>,
<i>emancipate</i>, <i>formula</i>, <i>heir</i>, <i>peculiar</i>, <i>prejudice</i>, <i>private</i>,
<i>property</i>, and <i>testament</i> are a few more examples of
the same process, chosen from a great many.</p>

<p>Naturally many of these words came into the
English language just after the Conquest. The French,
being so much nearer to Rome, both in blood and in
space, were a century or two ahead of the Teutons
in their civilization, and the Normans, after their long
sojourn on the Continent, brought with them to England
quite a complicated system of legislature and
executive. Besides the Latin words to which we have
referred, there are a large number of legal terms which
are not so easily recognizable as Latin, having passed
through Late Latin, Low Latin, and Early French
colloquial speech before they reached our shores. In
some cases they only developed a specifically legal
sense in Late Latin or even Early French. Yet because
the whole spirit of Roman civilization had been so
impregnated with legalism, the capacity for expressing
exact legal ideas seems to have remained latent,
through all their curious vicissitudes, in such words as
<i>assize</i> (literally ‘a sitting down’), <i>court</i>, <i>judge</i>, <i>jury</i>,
<i>county</i>, <i>district</i>, <i>manor</i>, <i>rent</i>,... Lawyers have gone
on employing a queer kind of Anglo-French, in some
cases, right down to the present day. The official
use of “Law French” in legal documents was only
recently abandoned, and such technical terms as <i>champerty</i>,
<i>feme sole</i>, <i>tort</i>, ... survive to remind us of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
days when an English-speaking lawyer would naturally
write such a sentence as:</p>

<p><span lang="fr">Arsons de measons felonisement faits est felony per
le comen ley.</span> (Arson of houses committed with
felonious intent is felony by the common law.)</p>

<p><i>Convey</i>, <i>felon</i>, <i>forfeit</i>, <i>lease</i>, <i>mortgage</i>, <i>perjury</i>, <i>plaintiff</i>,
and <i>defendant</i>, on the other hand, have acquired a
somewhat more general use; and indeed this Frenchified
jargon, partly imported and partly built up by
English lawyers as they went along, has produced in
later times several words which the language as a
whole would find it hard to do without. Among them
are <i>assets</i> (French ‘assez’), <i>burglar</i>, <i>cancel</i>, <i>conventional</i>,
<i>disclaim</i>, <i>flotsam</i> and <i>jetsam</i>, <i>jettison</i>, <i>improve</i>,
<i>matter-of-fact</i>, <i>mere</i>, “the <i>premises</i>”, <i>realize</i>, <i>size</i>, and—in
its modern sense—<i>franchise</i>; while <i>culprit</i>, which
was used in court down to the eighteenth century,
has an interesting history of its own. In former days,
when the prisoner had pleaded “Not Guilty”, the
Clerk of the Crown would open proceedings by saying
“Culpable: prest”, meaning that the prisoner <i>is</i>
“guilty”, and I am “ready” to prove it. In the
official records of the case this formula was abbreviated,
first to ‘cul-prest’ and afterwards to ‘cul-prit’, until
later clerks formed the habit of running the two words
together.</p>

<p>Looking at such words as <i>cancel</i>, <i>improve</i>, <i>realize</i>,
and <i>size</i>, we can feel the force of Professor Maitland’s
remark that in the Middle Ages “Law was the point
where life and logic met”. It served another purpose
besides that of establishing a secure polity; for
through it some of the new Latin words which were
gradually being created by its own, or translated
from Greek, thought by the abstruse scholastic
philosophy of the day found their way into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
vocabulary of the people. Even the old word <i>cause</i>
seems to have reached us by way of the law courts.
They were thus the pipe through which a little of
that hard thinking by the few, which underpins every
great civilization, could flow into the common consciousness
of the many, and in their terminology we
can see most clearly an example of that never-pausing
process by which the speculative metaphysics of
yesterday are transformed into the “common sense”
of to-day.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">The English language has been facetiously
described as “French badly pronounced”. At
the death of Chaucer, and for nearly a hundred years
afterwards, this description would have been very
nearly a true one. Apart from the adoption of a few
Latin words, changes seem to have been few and
insignificant during the fifteenth century, and we may
assume that, for the first half of it at any rate, the
Hundred Years’ War was occupying too many of our
energies to leave much time for cultural growth.
Nevertheless, from developments such as those which
have been pointed out in some of our legal terminology
we can feel something of the way in which the genius
of the English language was steadily, if slowly, reasserting
itself and claiming its right to a separate
personality. At the Reformation, when England
finally shook herself free from the dangerous embraces
of the Holy Roman Empire, the period of excessive
French influence came to an end. The general effect
of Protestantism on our language, subtle and profound
as it has been, will be dealt with later, but the
Reformation cannot be passed over here without
recording one instance in which a word—perhaps a
misunderstood word—has had extraordinarily lasting
results. It is the confusion of the English <i>Sunday</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
with the Jewish <i>Sabbath</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the consequent fastening
upon that day of rest of many of the sombre inhibitions
entailed by Sabbatic Law.</p>

<p>There is, however, another historical event which
had a far more universal and direct bearing on English
words, and that is the Revival of Learning. The new
intercourse with the ancient literatures of Greece and
Rome naturally brought into English a positive stream
of “literary borrowings”. At first these were mostly
Latin words. If we try to imagine an English from
which such words as <i>accommodate</i>, <i>capable</i>, <i>capacious</i>,
<i>compute</i>, <i>corroborate</i>, <i>distinguish</i>, <i>efficacy</i>, <i>estimate</i>, <i>experiment</i>,
<i>insinuate</i>, <i>investigate</i>, and a host of others
equally common are as yet absent, we may partly
realize what an important part was played by the
Renaissance in producing the language in which we
speak and think. There is indeed good evidence that
the stream of new words flowed too fast at this time
for ordinary people to keep up with it. For instance,
many of the Latin words that were borrowed have
since fallen out of use. At the beginning of the
seventeenth century Francis Bacon, who is not a
fantastic writer, was using such unfamiliar expressions
as <i>contentation</i>, <i>contristation</i>, <i>digladiation</i>, <i>morigeration</i>,
<i>redargution</i>, <i>ventosity</i>, ... and somewhat before
this, when the Classical influx was at its height, it
was conspicuous enough to call forth several amusing
parodies. We remember Shakespeare’s Holofernes
in <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, and Sir Thomas Wilson
includes in his <i>Arte of Rhetorike</i> a fictitious letter
applying for a church benefice, in which he satirizes
as follows the Klondyke rush after fashionable
Latinity:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pondering, expending, and revoluting with myself, your
ingent affability, and ingenious capacity for mundane
affairs: I cannot but celebrate and extoll your magnifical
dexterity above all other. For how could you have
adepted such illustrate prerogative, and domestical
superiority, if the fecundity of your ingeny had not been
so fertile and wonderful pregnant?...</p>
</div>

<p>Now this outcrop of linguistic parody is significant
for other reasons too. It reminds us that the English
language had at last become “self-conscious”. In
former times the struggle between different ways of
saying the same thing, between the old and the new,
the native and the foreign, had generally worked itself
out under the surface, amid the unconscious preferences
of the mass of the people. Thus, the old English
translators who rendered the Latin ‘exodus’ as <i>outfaring</i>
and ‘discipulus’ (disciple) as <i>learning-boy</i>, were
not consciously trying to keep the Latin words out;
nor did the fourteenth-century author of a book, which
he called the <i>Againbite of Inwit</i>, have any academic
horror, as far as we know, of the new Latin borrowings
<i>remorse</i> and <i>conscience</i>, with one of which, at least, he
must have been familiar. The same may be said of
Wyclif, who translated ‘resurrectio’ <i>againrising</i> and
‘immortalitas’ <i>undeadliness</i>. These old writers anglicized
because it came natural to them to anglicize,
just as the next generation began to prefer the Latin
words. But it was not so in Italy, nor in France,
in both of which countries poets had long ago written
careful treatises on the beloved medium of their art,
their native language. And now, after the Revival
of Learning, in England, too, scholars and literary men
began to notice such things. Counterbalancing the enthusiasm
for Latin and Greek, there arose a “Purist”
movement of just the kind which has had such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
powerful effect on the development of modern German.
People tried to expel all “foreign” words from the
language; Sir John Cheke began a translation of the
New Testament in which none but native words were
to be used; and we find in his <cite>Matthew</cite> <i>moond</i> for
<i>lunatic</i>, <i>hundreder</i> for <i>centurion</i>, <i>frosent</i> (from-sent) for
<i>apostle</i>, <i>crossed</i> for <i>crucified</i>, <i>freshman</i> for <i>proselyte</i>, and
many other equally odd-sounding concoctions. To
look back in this way on the uncertainty and chaos
which reigned at the beginning of the seventeenth
century is to intensify our admiration for the scholarship
and poetic taste displayed by the devout compilers
of the Authorised Version.</p>

<p>If we were to look for another symptom of this
sometimes pedantic self-consciousness, we could find
it in the modern way of spelling <i>debt</i> and <i>doubt</i>. The
old orthography, <i>det</i> and <i>dout</i>, is a perfectly correct
English rendering of the French words from which they
are taken, but the scholars of the Renaissance, anxious
to show the ultimate derivation from the Latin stems
‘deb’ and ‘dub’, inserted an entirely unnecessary
“b” into the words, and there it has stayed ever
since. Sometimes, too, these Elizabethan dons made
learned howlers, as in the now abandoned spelling
<i>abhominable</i>, which arose from a quite false idea that
that adjective is derived from the Latin ‘ab’ (from)
and ‘homo’ (man).</p>

<p>One can also get a curiously vivid sense of the way
in which new Latin words had been streaming into
the language during the sixteenth century from
Bacon’s literary style. He is so fond of placing a
Latin and an English word side by side, in order to
express what is virtually a single idea, that two
consecutive pages of the <cite>Advancement of Learning</cite>
supply no less than ten examples of this habit. Among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
them are <i>immoderate and overweening</i>, <i>action and
business</i>, <i>charge and accusation</i>, <i>eloquence and speech</i>.
To understand the exact effect which this kind of
writing must have had on the ears of his contemporaries
we must try and realize the faintly novel
and difficult sound with which many of these Latin
syllables would still be ringing. No such effort is
required, however, to comprehend the way in which
this deliberate duplication must have helped to
familiarize English people with the sound and meaning
of the new words.</p>

<p>Very soon the Greek language too began to be drawn
upon, though never to quite the same extent as Latin.
Thus, English of the fifteenth century must also be
thought of as a language in which hundreds of familiar
words like <i>apology</i>, <i>apostrophe</i>, <i>bucolic</i>, <i>climax</i>, <i>drama</i>,
<i>emphasis</i>, <i>encyclopedia</i>, <i>epidemic</i>, <i>epilogue</i>, <i>episode</i>,
<i>hypothesis</i>, <i>hysterical</i>, <i>paragraph</i>, <i>parallel</i>, <i>paraphrase</i>,
<i>physical</i>, do not yet exist, for these are all examples
of words which came in with the Renaissance.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
number of technical terms of art and literature is
particularly noticeable, and it was now that the
foundations were laid of that almost automatic system
whereby a new Greek-English word is coined to mark
each advance that is made in science, and especially
in mechanical science. <i>Automatic</i> is itself an example,
and it is hardly necessary to add <i>chronometer</i>, <i>dynamo</i>,
<i>magneto</i>, <i>metronome</i>, <i>telescope</i>, <i>theodolite</i>, <i>thermometer</i>,...</p>

<p>But though the stern lovers of their native tongue
were thus hopelessly outclassed, yet the mere existence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
of the conservative feeling which they tried to voice
must have acted as a useful brake on the too indiscriminate
adoption of new words. The English language
was, in fact, settling down. It was in the future
to receive countless additions—never to change its
very essence as it had done in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. And thus, as we look on towards
the modern period, we find only fewer and more
scattered historical vestiges. But if we can no longer
expect etymology to tell us anything approaching to
a complete and coherent tale, it will nevertheless still
light up for us from different angles different little
portions of that dark, mysterious mass, the past.</p>

<p>By the sixteenth century, for example, that peculiarly
English characteristic, the love of sport, had already
begun to make its mark on the language. <i>Sport</i> itself
is an abbreviation of ‘disport’, a French word meaning
‘to carry oneself in a different direction from that
of one’s ordinary business’. It is interesting to
observe how both the form and meaning of the English
word have diverged from their origin, and how they
have since been reborrowed into French and most of
the other languages of Europe. Italian tailors will
even use the vocable to describe a roll of loud check
cloth! Of the older sports, hawking has given us
<i>allure</i>, <i>haggard</i>, <i>rebate</i>, and <i>reclaim</i>. The Latin ‘reclamare’
had meant ‘to cry out against’ or ‘to
contradict’; it was only in hawking that it acquired
its present sense of ‘calling back’ from the cries that
were uttered to summon the hawk back to the wrist.
<i>Allure</i> is from the old <i>lure</i>, an apparatus for recalling
the birds, and <i>haggard</i> is a word of obscure etymology
which was used of a wild hawk. <i>Forte</i> and <i>foible</i> are
old fencing terms, describing the strong and weak
(<i>feeble</i>) points of a sword. <i>Couple</i>, <i>muse</i>, <i>relay</i>, <i>retrieve</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
(French ‘retrouver’), <i>run riot</i>, <i>ruse</i>, <i>sagacious</i>, <i>tryst</i>,
and <i>worry</i> we owe to hunting, as also the development
of the Latin ‘sentire’ into the English word
<i>scent</i>. Of these the most interesting are perhaps <i>muse</i>,
which is supposed to be derived from the same word
as <i>muzzle</i>, and <i>ruse</i>, another form of <i>rush</i>. The
hounds were said to ‘muzzle’ when they sniffed the
air in doubt about the scent, and a <i>ruse</i> was a doubling
of the hunted animal on its own tracks. <i>Rove</i> (but
not <i>rover</i>) is from archery, meaning in the first place
‘to shoot arrows at an arbitrarily selected target’.
<i>Bias</i>, <i>bowl over</i>, and <i>rub</i> in the phrase ‘there’s the
rub’ are from bowls, <i>crestfallen</i> and <i>white feather</i> from
cockfighting, and <i>chess</i>, <i>check</i>, <i>checkmate</i>, <i>cheque</i>, and
<i>chequer</i> come to us through the Arabian from Persian,
the central word being a corruption of the Persian
‘Shah mat’, meaning ‘The Shah (the King) is dead’.
It is not so generally known that all the varied
meanings of these words are metaphors taken either
from the game or from the board on which it is
played.</p>

<p>The more modern sports do not yet seem to have
provided us with many new words, but there is a
promising tendency to transmute some of their
technical terms into lively idiom. In this way we
can use, for example, to <i>sprint</i>, to <i>put on a spurt</i>, the
<i>last lap</i>, <i>clean bowled</i>, to <i>take his middle stump</i>, to
<i>skate on thin ice</i>, to <i>kick off</i>, to <i>tee off</i>, <i>one up</i>,...;
and modern games have also been instrumental in
preserving from oblivion the odd old French word
<i>bisque</i>, of unknown origin, which came over to England
with the now nearly obsolete game of tennis, as well
as the French-Scottish <i>caddie</i>.</p>

<p>When we hear a golfer use this word, when we hear
a Scotch person ask for an <i>aschet</i>, instead of a dish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
or see the queer expression <i>petticoat-tales</i> on a tin of
Edinburgh shortbread, we are taken back to the close
connection between the French and Scottish Courts
which existed in the days of Mary Stuart. For <i>caddie</i>
is a corruption of the French “cadet” (younger son),
whence also modern English <i>cad</i> and <i>cadet</i>; <i>aschet</i> is
a form of the French ‘assiette’; and <i>petticoat-tales</i>
a corruption of ‘<span lang="fr">petits gateaux</span>’ (little cakes).</p>

<p>Another phenomenon of history which is very
faithfully preserved in the English language is our
long-standing and not always creditable nautical
relations with the Dutch. From the fourteenth to
the seventeenth century Dutch sea words continued
to trickle into the language, the fourteenth seeing the
arrival of <i>bowsprit</i> and <i>skipper</i>, the fifteenth of <i>freight</i>,
<i>hoy</i>, <i>keel</i>, <i>lighter</i>, <i>pink</i>, <i>pump</i>, <i>scout</i>, <i>marline</i>, and
<i>buoy</i>, the sixteenth of <i>aloof</i>, <i>belay</i>, <i>dock</i>, <i>mesh</i>, <i>reef</i>,
<i>rover</i>, and <i>flyboat</i>, while the seventeenth century, when
Van Tromp nailed his broom to the mast, the Dutch
fleet sailed up the Medway, and William of Orange
sat upon the English throne, gave us <i>avast</i>, <i>bow</i>,
<i>boom</i>, <i>cruise</i>, <i>cruiser</i>, <i>gybe</i>, and <i>keelhaul</i>. Besides these
maritime words English possesses certain military
memories of the Dutch. <i>Freebooter</i> goes back to the
war with Spain in the reign of Elizabeth, and <i>cashier</i>,
<i>domineer</i>, <i>drill</i>, <i>furlough</i>, and <i>onslaught</i> are also among
the words brought back from the Low Countries by
English soldiers. A particularly freakish Dutch borrowing
is the apparently English <i>forlorn hope</i>, which
is in reality a popular corruption of the Flemish
‘verloren hoop’, a phrase that has nothing to do with
hope and means a ‘lost expedition’.</p>

<p>The Spanish words in the English language, like the
Dutch, are few in number, but often full of history.
Those which came originally from Arabic—the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
interesting of all—will be dealt with in <a href="#ARA">another chapter</a>.
We received them for the most part through the
French. <i>Alligator</i>,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>chocolate</i>, <i>cocoa</i>, and <i>tomato</i>, which
come through Spanish from Mexican, commemorate
the Spanish conquest of Mexico, and the poetic <i>breeze</i>
is a sixteenth-century adaptation of the Spanish ‘briza’,
a name for the north-east trade wind in the Spanish
Main. Of the other words which come to us through
Spanish <i>cannibal</i>, <i>hammock</i>, <i>hurricane</i>, <i>maize</i>, and
<i>savannah</i> are Caribbean, while <i>canoe</i>, <i>potato</i>, and <i>tobacco</i>
are South American. <i>Cannibal</i>, like the names <i>West
Indies</i> and <i>Indian</i> (meaning ‘aboriginal inhabitant
of America’), hides a more detailed history. It was
brought back by Christopher Columbus, who believed,
when he reached the islands of the Caribbean Sea, that
he had sailed right round the world, back to the
east coast of India. The name ‘Caniba’—a variant
of ‘Carib’ or ‘Caribes’—he took as a proof that
the inhabitants were subjects of the Grand Khan of
Tartary.</p>

<p>We can see, then, how the new impulse towards
travel and exploration which followed the Renaissance
left behind, when it ebbed, many exotic and exotic-sounding
words whose etymologies can tell us not a
little of the nationality of those adventurous mariners
who led the way to the East and to the new world.
The Spaniards were not the only explorers. The
Indian words <i>coolie</i> and <i>curry</i> come to us through
Portuguese; <i>banana</i> and <i>negro</i> reached us from Africa,
possibly by the same route; and <i>cocoanut</i> is from the
Portuguese ‘coco’, a bugbear or bogy—alluding to
the nut’s monkey-like face. <i>Drub</i>—once used only
of the bastinado—is thought to be an Arabic word
brought back by suffering Christians from the Barbary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
States. <i>Amuck</i>, <i>bamboo</i>, and <i>cockatoo</i>, come from
Malayan through Portuguese, and <i>caddy</i> (the receptacle)
from Malayan direct. <i>Moccasin</i>, <i>tomahawk</i>,
and <i>hickory</i> are among the words sent back to us by
the seventeenth-century English settlers in North
America. <i>Taboo</i>, <i>tattoo</i>, and <i>kangaroo</i> came home with
Captain Cook from the Pacific.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the civil and political history of England
has been growing steadily. <i>Political</i>, <i>politics</i>, <i>politician</i>,
and <i>parliamentary</i> first appear in the sixteenth century,
and <i>Cabinet Council</i> seems to have been introduced
at the accession of Charles I. <i>Cabal</i>, one of the few
Hebrew words in the English language, probably owes
its familiarity to two historical events. It was applied
in Charles II’s reign to a small committee of the Privy
Council, also known as the “Committee for Foreign
Affairs”, which afterwards became the Cabinet;
moreover, a little later on it happened that the names
of the five Ministers who signed the Treaty of Alliance
with France against Holland were Clifford, Arlington,
Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale. Their initials
thus arranged spell the word <i>cabal</i>, which was
humorously used to describe them. Another far
commoner expression which dates back to the Civil
War is the phrase ‘the <i>army</i>.’ It reminds us that
we had no standing army until after the foundation
of the Parliamentary Forces. <i>Cavalier</i> and <i>Roundhead</i>
are words which carry their history, so to speak, on
their sleeves. They were both coined as terms of
abuse, and among other uncivil relics of the Civil
War which have found a more extended application,
<i>fanatic</i> and <i>Puritan</i> were invented by the Royalists
and <i>malignant</i> by the Roundheads. <i>Independent</i> and
<i>independence</i> are also Puritan words, and the useful
<i>demagogue</i> first appeared in the <cite lang="la">Eikon Basilike</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the famous pamphlet in defence of the Crown, which
Milton answered with his <cite lang="la">Eikonoklastes</cite>. The expression
<i>to send to Coventry</i> is probably a gift from
the rebellious citizens of Birmingham, who, according
to Clarendon, frequently “rose upon small parties of
the King’s” and either killed them or sent them, as
prisoners, to Coventry, which was a Parliamentary
stronghold.</p>

<p>Spite, which always loves a rich vocabulary, is also
the father of those venerable labels <i>tory</i> and <i>whig</i>.
The old Celtic word <i>tory</i> was first applied in the
seventeenth century to the unfortunate Irish Catholics,
dispossessed by Cromwell, who became savage outlaws
living chiefly upon plunder; after that it was used
for some time of bandits in general, and at the close
of James II’s reign the “Exclusioners” found it a
conveniently offensive nickname for those who favoured
the succession of the Roman Catholic James, Duke of
York. Thus, when William of Orange finally succeeded
in reaching the throne, it became the approved name
of one of the two great political parties in Great
Britain. <i>Whig</i> is a shortened form of <i>whiggamore</i>, a
name given to certain Scotchmen from the word
<i>whiggam</i>, which they used in driving their horses. It
was first used of the rebellious Scottish Covenanters
who marched to Edinburgh in 1648; then of the
Exclusioners, who were opposed to the accession of
James; and finally, from 1689 onwards, of the other
great political party or one of its adherents.</p>

<p>That the seventeenth century saw the true genesis
of many of our commercial and financial institutions
is suggested by the fact that their names first appear
at this time. Such are <i>capital</i>, which is a doublet of
<i>cattle</i>—the very oldest Aryan form of wealth<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>—<i>commercial</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
<i>discount</i>, <i>dividend</i>, <i>insurance</i>, <i>investment</i>,
and lastly the modern meaning of <i>bank</i>, which, like
the names of so many protective and responsible
institutions—the <i>Assizes</i>, the <i>Bench</i>, the <i>Consulate</i>,
the <i>Council</i>, the <i>Chair</i> at a public meeting, a <i>Seat</i> in
Parliament, and the <i>Throne</i>—is based etymologically
on what we may call one of the oldest and safest of
human occupations. The old Teutonic word which
subsequently became modern English <i>bench</i> was
adopted into Italian, probably from the Teutonic
Lombards of northern Italy, in the form ‘banco’.
It soon acquired the special sense of a moneychanger’s
‘bench’ or table and found its way, together with
the object it represents, into most of the countries
of Europe. Thus, like the name <i>Lombard Street</i>, the
little word carries us back with it to the origin of
banking in northern Italy and to Edward I’s substitution
of Italian <i>bankers</i> for Jewish moneylenders.
<i>Bankruptcy</i>, <i>currency</i>, and <i>remittance</i> appeared in the
first half of the eighteenth century, and in the second
<i>bonus</i>, <i>capitalist</i>, <i>consols</i>, and <i>finance</i>. The history of
<i>finance</i> is again interesting. The word goes right back
to the Latin ‘finis’ (end). When it first appeared
in English, it had the sense of a ‘fine’ or forfeit, but
its modern significance was developed in eighteenth-century
France among the tax-farmers or ‘financiers’,
as they were called, to whom the king delegated the
duty of collecting his taxes. As time went on, these
shrewd individuals amalgamated into a sort of limited
company, which, by a judicious application of the
principles of usury, gradually gained more and more
control over the revenue, until “<span lang="fr">toutes les finances
du royaume</span>”, as Voltaire says, “<span lang="fr">dépendirent d’une
compagnie de commerce</span>”. In England the phrase
<i>Bank of England</i> first appears in 1694, describing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
a body of individuals associated for the purpose of
lending money to the Government; and about thirty
years later this still (1925) outstanding loan began to
be known as the <i>National Debt</i>.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the eighteenth century
commercial and financial considerations seem to have
played a steadily increasing part in determining the
nation’s policy. Horace Walpole is the first person
known to have used <i>speculation</i> in the sense of buying
and selling stocks and shares; and <i>budget</i> (a little
bag or pocket) may owe its modern political meaning
to a pamphlet sarcastically entitled <cite>The Budget
Opened</cite>, in which his brother Robert’s financial
policy received some severe handling. <i>Prime Minister</i>
also takes us back to Sir Robert Walpole, to whom
it was applied with derisive innuendo, for it had in
those days more the sense of ‘Grand Vizier’ or
despot’s tool. In the old-fashioned <i>nabob</i>, as a
synonym for ‘plutocrat’, we have a memory of the
latter days of the East India Company when the
squandering of large sums of money in London often
rounded off a life of empire-building in Bombay or
Calcutta. The dictionary suggests, however, that
later generations of Anglo-Indians preferred to bring
back with them less questionable impedimenta, such
as <i>pyjamas</i> and <i>shampoo</i>.</p>

<p>The phrase, the <i>Rights of Man</i>, takes us back to
the American Declaration of Independence. The borrowing
of <i>aristocrat</i> and <i>democrat</i> from French, the
French word <i>guillotine</i>, and the appearance in English
of <i>revolutionize</i> and <i>terrorize</i> are enduring relics of the
French Revolution, and the word <i>sectional</i>, which came
in in the nineteenth century, is closely bound up with
the history of France, for it is derived (together with
the geographical use of <i>section</i>) from the division of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
France into electoral sections under the Directory.
The military meaning of <i>conscription</i> goes back to
the France of the same period. To the campaigns in
the Soudan we owe <i>zareeba</i>, and to the Boer War the
Dutch words <i>kopje</i> and <i>spoor</i>. It is too early yet to
say what verbal legacy the European War has left
us, but the anonymous <i>stunt</i> and <i>gadget</i> (small
mechanical contrivance), and the French <i>camouflage</i>
seem to have taken a fairly firm hold, while the
expressions <i>eyewash</i>, to <i>scrounge</i> (meaning to ‘steal’),
to <i>get the wind up</i>, to <i>go west</i>, and possibly to <i>swing the
lead</i> (to be idle at somebody else’s expense), are idioms
which show no signs of departing from us yet. President
Wilson’s <i>self-determination</i> has probably been
added to half the languages of the world.</p>

<p>A list of new words like <i>anaesthetic</i>, <i>galvanometer</i>,
<i>morse</i>, <i>railroad</i>, <i>telephone</i>, <i>turbine</i>, ... which appeared
in the nineteenth century, would tell a full and fairly
accurate story of its extraordinarily sudden mechanical
and scientific development, but such a list has yet to
be compiled. More interesting in many ways are the
appearance of new metaphors and idioms, such as to
<i>peter out</i>, to <i>pan out</i> (from mining), to <i>blow off</i> or <i>get
up steam</i>, and to <i>go off the rails</i> from the steam engine,
and many electrical metaphors such as those mentioned
in <a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>. For new ways of doing are bound
up with new ways of knowing and thinking, and the
true story of the nineteenth century, as of every other
century, is the story of its mental and emotional
outlook. To this long and intricate story the rest
of this book is devoted, but before passing on to it
a few aspects of our subject, with which there is not
space to deal fully, may perhaps be mentioned.</p>

<p>The light thrown by certain words on the social
history of England, as opposed to her political history,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
is a clear and often a new one. To look up in the
<i>Oxford Dictionary</i> such words as <i>blackguard</i>, <i>carol</i>, <i>club</i>,
<i>morris</i>, <i>teetotal</i>, or a thousand others which seem
to have no particular historical significance, and to
read through the many illustrative quotations, is to
take a wonderfully easy and intimate peep into the
past; while the dates at which such words as <i>magazine</i>,
<i>news-letter</i>, <i>newspaper</i>, <i>novelist</i>, <i>press</i>, or again,
<i>callers</i>, <i>small talk</i>, <i>tea-party</i>, <i>snob</i>, <i>antimacassar</i>, ...
appeared, together with quotations showing the particular
shades of meaning with which they have been
used, are in themselves a little history of the English
people. What could be more suggestive, for instance,
than the fact that the adjective <i>improper</i> was first
applied to human beings in the early fifties?</p>

<p>Words which are derived from the names of real
individuals, as <i>bowdlerize</i>, <i>boycott</i>, <i>burke</i>, <i>derrick</i>,
<i>dunce</i>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <i>galvanize</i>, <i>mesmerism</i>, <i>morse</i>, <i>sandwich</i>, <i>tawdry</i>,
or fictitious ones, as <i>gamp</i>, <i>knickerbocker</i>, <i>lilliputian</i>,
<i>quixotic</i>, <i>pamphlet</i>, <i>pickwickian</i>, are sometimes, but
not always historically interesting. Again, the place-names
of England, whether of country villages or
London streets, are heavily loaded with the past, but
the subject is such a vast and disconnected one that
it would require a volume to itself.</p>

<p>The characteristics of nations, as of races, are fairly
accurately reflected linguistically in the metaphors and
idioms they choose, in their tricks of grammar, in
their various ways of forming new words. It is, for
obvious reasons, easier to apply this principle to other
nations than to one’s own; nevertheless there are a
few such points which English people can observe
even in the English language. The number of words
and expressions drawn from sport is a phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
which has already been touched upon, and it is at
any rate a question whether humour has not played
a larger part in the creation of English and American
words than in those of other languages. The French
‘tête’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is humorous in origin, and there must be other
French and Latin-French words with a similar history,
but English has really quite a number of words in
which humour has taken a hand. One way in which
this comes about is the process known as back-formation.
We realize the humorous intention when
somebody invents from the noun <i>swashbuckler</i> a verb
to <i>swashbuckle</i>, or to <i>buttle</i> and <i>cuttle</i> from <i>butler</i> and
<i>cutler</i>, but it is not so well known that the same
process (probably with the same humorous intent
behind it) gave us such sober words as <i>burgle</i>, <i>sidle</i>,
<i>edit</i>, <i>grovel</i>, <i>beg</i>, and <i>greed</i>. One of the most interesting
back-formations is the verb to <i>maffick</i>, formed from
the supposed present participle <i>mafficking</i>, which was
coined to describe the festivities that greeted the
arrival in London of the news of the relief of Mafeking
during the Boer War. The well-known humorous
device of understatement is responsible for the modern
meaning of <i>hit</i> and most of its synonyms. The notion
of striking was once conveyed by the verb to <i>slay</i>;
by Tudor times, however, <i>smite</i>, which in Old English
meant to ‘smear’ or ‘rub over’, had become the
commoner word. <i>Strike</i> itself in Old English meant
‘to stroke’ or ‘to rub gently’, and <i>hit</i>, which is now
universal in serious colloquial speech, meant to ‘meet
with’ or ‘light upon’—‘not to miss’, in fact; just
as to <i>win</i> (‘not to lose’) something means, or
recently meant, in the British Army, to <i>steal</i> it. <i>Blow</i>
and <i>thrash</i> are both sly agricultural metaphors, and
the present popularity of such slang phrases as <i>wipe</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
meaning a blow, and to <i>wipe out</i>, suggests that this
pleasing and rather simple form of humour is still
active in English word-formation.</p>

<p>But the number of these little etymological sidetracks
is almost infinite. We might, for instance, ask
ourselves whether the colloquial use of <i>chap</i> for
‘individual’ (from the Old English ‘cheapen’ to ‘buy’,
cognate with <i>chapman</i>, <i>cheap</i>, <i>Cheapside</i>, ...) is really
the unconscious self-expression of a nation of shopkeepers,
or whether it is purely accidental; in which
connection we should have to notice the modern
tendency to renew a faded metaphor by substituting
the word <i>merchant</i>, and so on. But the truly scientific
way of approaching this part of our subject is to study
the various English words which have been adopted
by foreign nations, and the meanings they have
developed there.</p>

<p>These were few enough up to the end of the seventeenth
century, but from then on their number and
importance increased; and we cannot help being
interested in them, whether on the one hand the
foreigner has merely employed them in despair of
finding any word in his own language adequate to
describe the object or idiosyncrasy in question, or
whether his adoption of them implies that he has
also borrowed the things of which they are the names.
In the first of these classes we should probably put
<i>cant</i>, <i>comfort</i>, <i>gentleman</i>, <i>humbug</i>, <i>humour</i>, <i>respectability</i>,
<i>romantic</i>, <i>sentimental</i>, <i>snobbism</i>, <i>spleen</i>,...; in
the second, <i>ale</i>, <i>beefsteak</i>, <i>gin</i>, <i>grog</i>, <i>mackintosh</i>, <i>pudding</i>,
<i>riding-coat</i> (redingote), <i>roast-beef</i>, <i>rum</i>, <i>sport</i>, <i>sportsman</i>,
<i>waterproof</i>, <i>whisky</i>, and various technical terms
of sport such as <i>box</i>, <i>Derby</i>, <i>handicap</i>, <i>jockey</i>,...</p>

<p>To the second group also would belong our most
important contributions to foreign languages—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
political words. When we find <i>bill</i>, <i>budget</i>, <i>committee</i>,
<i>jury</i>, <i>lock-out</i>, <i>meeting</i>, <i>pamphlet</i>, <i>speech</i>, <i>strike</i>, <i>trade-union</i>,
... on the Continent, and realize that the
modern meanings of European words such as <i>constitution</i>,
<i>represent</i>, <i>vote</i>, or of Old French words like
<i>address</i>, <i>majority</i>, <i>minority</i>, <i>motion</i>, <i>parliament</i>, ... are
derived from English, we feel ourselves in the presence,
not so much of something peculiarly English as of
something universal which England has been the means
of bringing to earth. That vast theoretical terms
like <i>liberty</i>, <i>equality</i>, and <i>fraternity</i> should be borrowed
by England from France in return for <i>committee</i>, <i>jury</i>,
<i>meeting</i>, ... that the French <i>idéalogue</i> and <i>doctrinaire</i>
should be bartered for <i>utilitarian</i> and <i>experimental</i>—these
facts have been taken to indicate a
certain division of function in the economy of European
social evolution, the Frenchman producing the abstract
moral ideals and the Englishman attempting to clothe
them with reality. And it may be that in such
important loan-words as <i>club</i> and <i>freemason</i> and <i>sport</i>,
but, above all, in <i>committee</i>—that sensitive instrument
for maintaining the balance as between individual and
associative personality—we can perceive the Englishman’s
secret: his power of voluntary co-operation, and
his innate understanding of the give-and-take it
requires.</p>

<p>While we can hardly expect to see an undistorted
reflection of ourselves in the first group of words
mentioned above, yet the grotesque meanings which
many of them have acquired abroad are interesting
partly for that very reason. They enable us, if studied
carefully, to see ourselves not only as others see us,
but as others saw us. And from both groups together
we can re-create, as Mr. Pearsall Smith has pointed
out, something of the curious England which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
‘discovered’ about the middle of the eighteenth
century by the rest of Europe, can rejoice with Voltaire
in her atmosphere of religious toleration and personal
liberty, and admire with Montesquieu her haphazard
constitution; we can take back to our native France
or Germany romantic and sentimental memories of
<i><span lang="fr">le ‘lovely moon’ des Anglois</span></i>, or, better still, delving
farther into the past, we can stride across the Italian
stage in our top boots and our <i>redingote</i>, a moody and
spleenful English <i>milord</i>, liable to commit suicide at
any moment.</p>

<p>Important as they are, however, we must not be
misled by this little group of words into supposing
that English is a language which has given away
much. On the contrary, surveying it as a whole, we
are struck, above all, by the ease with which it has
itself appropriated the linguistic products of others.
Like Mr. Shaw’s Shakespeare, its genius seems to have
lain not so much in originality as in the snapping up
of unconsidered trifles; and where it has excelled all
the other languages of Europe, possibly of the world,
is in the grace with which it has hitherto digested
these particles of foreign matter and turned them into
its own life’s blood. Historically, the English language
is a muddle; actually it is a beautiful, personal, and
highly sensitive creature.</p>

<span class="fs110">MYTH</span></h3>

<p class="p1b pfs90"><i>Panic.</i> <i>Tuesday.</i> <i>Money.</i> <i>Sorcery.</i> <i>Man.</i></p>

<p class="drop-capy">Let us take two common English words, <i>panic</i>
and <i>cereal</i>, and compare them etymologically;
we owe both of them to the personages of classical
mythology. <i>Cereal</i> comes to us from Ceres, the Roman
goddess of corn and flowers, and <i>panic</i> is from Pan,
a Greek Nature-god, who was regarded as the protector
of flocks and herds. But here the resemblance ends;
for not only is one Latin and the other Greek, but one
is the name of an object which we can touch and see,
while the other relates to that inner world of human
consciousness which cannot be grasped with hands.
Now it is important to notice that the <i>word</i> is very
much more closely connected with the <i>thing</i> in the
case of <i>panic</i> than in the case of <i>cereal</i>. Certainly,
we are interested to know that one of our words for
corn is derived from the name of a Roman goddess,
but we do not feel that it has much effect on our own
ideas about corn. We feel, in fact, that a study of
the word <i>cereal</i> will tell us something about Rome,
but very little either about corn or about ourselves.
With <i>panic</i> it is different. In that intangible inner
world words are themselves, as it were, the solid
materials. Yet they are not solid as stones are, but
rather as human faces, which sometimes change their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
form as the inner man changes, and sometimes,
remaining practically unaltered, express with the same
configuration a developed personality. “Human
speech and human thought,” said the psychologist,
Wundt, “are everywhere coincident.... The development
of human consciousness includes in itself
the development of modes of expression. Language
is an essential element of the function of thinking.”</p>

<p>There was a time when no such word as <i>panic</i>
existed, just as there was a time when no such word
as <i>electric</i> existed, and in this case, as in the other,
before the word first sprang into life in somebody’s
imagination, humanity’s whole awareness of the
phenomenon which we describe as ‘panic’ must have
been a different thing. The word marks a discovery
in the inner world of consciousness,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> just as <i>electric</i><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
marks a discovery in the outer world of physical
phenomena. Now it was said that the connection of
the latter word, in its Greek form, with <i>amber</i>
would be informative if we had no other means of
determining the electrical properties of that substance.
Words like <i>panic</i> are important, because we really
have no other means of determining how the ancients,
who lived before the days of literature and written
records, thought and felt about such matters. The
word enables us to realize that the early Greeks could
become conscious of this phenomenon, and thus name
it, because they felt the presence of an invisible being
who swayed the emotions of flocks and herds. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
it also reveals how this kind of outlook<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> changed
slowly into the abstract idea which the modern
individual strives to express when <i>he</i> uses the word
<i>panic</i>. At last, as that idea grows more abstract still,
the expression itself may change; yet, just as the
power to think of the “quality” of an article was
shown to be the gift of Plato, so it would be impossible
for us to think, feel, or say such things as ‘crowd-psychology’
or ‘herd-instinct’ if the Greeks had not
thought, felt, said ‘Pan’—as impossible as it would
be to have the leaf of a plant without first having a
seed tucked into the warm earth. <i>Hero</i>, which
originally meant a being who was half-human and
half-divine, is a similar descendant from Greek
religion which could not be extinguished from our
vocabulary without restricting our outlook.</p>

<p>As to the number of words which are indirectly
descended from prehistorical religious feeling, it is not
possible to count them. We can only say that the
farther back language as a whole is traced, the more
poetical and animated do its sources appear, until
it seems at last to dissolve into a kind of mist of myth.
The beneficence or malignance—what may be called
the soul-qualities—of natural phenomena, such as
clouds or plants or animals, make a more vivid impression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
at this time than their outer shapes and
appearances.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Words themselves are felt to be alive
and to exert a magical influence. But, as the period
which has elapsed since the beginning of the Aryan
culture is only a tiny fragment of the whole epoch
during which man has been able to speak, it is only
in glimpses that we can perceive this; in a word here
and a word there we trace but the final stages of a
vast, age-long metamorphosis from the kind of outlook
which we loosely describe as ‘mythological’ to the
kind which we may describe equally loosely as
‘intellectual thought’. To comprehend the process
fully, we must build up the rest of it in the imagination,
just as, from seeing a foot of cliff crumble away
at Dover, we may set wings to time and call up the
immemorial formation of the English Channel.</p>

<p>The English words <i>diurnal</i>, <i>diary</i>, <i>dial</i> are derived
from the Latin ‘dies’ (day), while <i>journal</i> comes to
us, via the French language, from the same word.
These syllables conceal among themselves the central
religious conception common to the Aryan nations.
As far back as we can trace them, the Sanskrit word
‘dyaus’, the Greek ‘zeus’ (accusative ‘dia’), and
the Teutonic ‘tiu’ were all used in contexts where
we should use the word <i>sky</i>; but the same words
were also used to mean <i>God</i>, the Supreme Being,
the Father of all the other gods—Sanskrit ‘Dyaus
pitar’, Greek ‘Zeus pater’, Illyrian ‘Deipaturos’,
Latin ‘Juppiter’ (old form ‘Diespiter’). We can
best understand what this means if we consider how
the English word <i>heaven</i> and the French ‘ciel’
are still used for a similar double purpose, and how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
it was once not a double purpose at all. Indeed,
there must still be English and French people for
whom the spiritual ‘heaven’ is identical with the
visible sky. But if we are to judge from language,
we must assume that when our earliest ancestors
looked up to the blue vault they felt that they saw
not merely a place, whether heavenly or earthly, but
the bodily vesture, as it were, of a living Being. And
this fact is still extant in the formal resemblance
between such words as <i>diary</i> and <i>divine</i>.</p>

<p>The French ‘Dieu’, with its close resemblance
to ‘dies’, retains the luminous suggestion of <i>day</i>
and <i>sky</i> very much more vividly than any of our
words from the same stem, but we have kept the
Teutonic form nearly intact in <i>Tuesday</i>. The fact
that ‘Tiu’s day’ came in as a translation of the Latin
‘Dies Martis’ (surviving in French ‘mardi’) also
suggests that for the Teutons, alone among the Aryans,
the supreme Father-God afterwards became their god
of war; and this may throw some light both on their
fundamental character and on the nature of the
experiences which they encountered during the
thousand odd years of their sojourn in the northern
forests.</p>

<p>It must not be assumed that the “ancestors” spoken
of above are identical with the Aryans described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">Chapter I</a>. By the time of the dispersion the thought
of “sky” may have been quite separated in the
average Aryan mind from the thought of “God”,
or it may not have been. We cannot say; we only
know that at one time, among the speakers of the
Aryan language, these two thoughts were one and the
same. It is impossible to fix a point in time, and then
to cut a kind of cross-section, and define the exact
relation between language and thought at that particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
moment. This relation—and especially in the
domain of religion—is a fluid and flickering thing,
varying incredibly in individual minds, leaping up and
sinking down like a flame from one generation to
another. Consequently no two theories on the religious
beliefs held by the Aryans in the third millennium <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
are alike; and we are concerned here only with those
modern words which are the product of Aryan religious
consciousness at some time or another in its history.</p>

<p>They come to us, naturally, by different routes, a
few by the south-eastern and any number by the
north-western group. <i>Pariah</i>, a non-Aryan word
which has come into our language from the East,
derives its peculiar forcibility from the age-old division
of India’s population into castes. <i>Ignite</i> is from the
Latin ‘ignis’, which is derived from the same parent
word as the Sanskrit ‘Agni’, the fire-god. In <i>magic</i>
we have a reminiscence of the Persian ‘Magi’, mighty
prophets and interpreters of dreams, of whom three
were said to have found their way to Bethlehem;
but unless it be in the modern trade-name <i>Mazda</i>,
there is little, if any, trace in our language of the great
Persian religion of Zoroastrianism, with its everlasting
conflict between light and darkness, Ahura Mazdao
and Ahriman. The meagreness in our language of
these relics of Hindoo and Persian religion is again
eloquent of the total separation of the north-western
and south-eastern Aryans. The whole vast structure
of Eastern philosophy, with its intricate classifications
cutting completely across our own, was practically
a sealed book to the West until after the French
re-established a commercial connection with India in
the eighteenth century. Signs are not wanting, however,
that the rapid growth of interest in this ancient
and lofty outlook, which has taken place in Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
during the last fifty years, may enrich our vocabulary
with some extracts from the ancient terminology, such,
for example, as <i>maya</i>—the soul’s external environment
considered as being ‘illusion’, or as obscuring and
concealing the spiritual reality, and <i>karma</i>, the destiny
of an individual as it is developed from incarnation
to incarnation.</p>

<p>To turn from these nations to a member of the
north-western group, such as Greece, is like passing
from an arid desert into a land flowing with milk and
honey. <i>Panic</i> and <i>hero</i> have already been mentioned.
<i>Iris</i> (the flower, and also the part of the human eye),
together with the beautiful word <i>iridescent</i>, have come
to us from the Greek goddess Iris, whose outer form
was the rainbow. <i>Titanic</i> is from the Titans, huge
earth-beings who rebelled against God much as did
the fallen angels in Genesis. <i>Hermetically</i> (in ‘hermetically
sealed’) comes to us from the Greek
messenger-god, Hermes, by a roundabout route (see
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>); and in more or less common use are
<i>Aphrodisiac</i>, <i>Apolline</i>, <i>Asia</i>, <i>Atlas</i>, <i>chimera</i>, <i>daedal</i>,
<i>Dionysiac</i>, <i>Elysian</i>, <i>Europe</i>, <i>Hades</i>, <i>harmony</i>, <i>lethal</i>,
<i>Muse</i> and <i>music</i>, <i>mystery</i>, <i>nemesis</i>, <i>nymph</i>, <i>paean</i>,
<i>panacea</i>, <i>phaeton</i>, <i>protean</i>, <i>satyr</i>, <i>siren</i>, <i>stygian</i>. The word
<i>erotic</i>, from Eros, a Greek god of love, is an interesting
example of the way in which the experiences of past
civilizations evaporate into essential refinements of
modern speech. Because of differences between Greece
and Rome, which it took about two thousand years
to work out on the stage of history, we are now able
to make a fine distinction, such as that between <i>erotic</i>
and <i>amorous</i>.</p>

<p>The true Roman god of love, however, though in
the world of phantasy he still survives in his original
form, <i>Cupid</i>, has only actually entered our language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
in the word <i>cupidity</i>. In the difference between the
material associations of <i>cupidity</i> and the more
imaginative ones of <i>erotic</i> we begin already to divine a
fundamental dissimilarity between Greek and Roman
mythology. Other words which come to us from
Roman religion are <i>cereal</i>, <i>genius</i>, <i>fate</i>, <i>fortune</i>, <i>fury</i>,
<i>grace</i>, <i>June</i>, <i>mint</i>, <i>money</i>, <i>Saturday</i>, <i>vesta</i>, the names
of the planets, <i>contemplate</i>, <i>sacrifice</i>, <i>temple</i>, <i>Host</i> (from
‘hostia’, the victim which was sacrificed), <i>augury</i>, and
<i>auspice</i>. The last two words take us back to the
Roman custom of divining the will of the gods
by watching the flights of birds. ‘Aves-specere’
meant ‘to see birds’, and we still have the
first word preserved to us in <i>aviary</i>. <i>Fury</i> and
<i>grace</i> are translations of Greek names; but in some
of the others—especially <i>money</i> and <i>mint</i>, from the
goddess Moneta—we behold the late reflection of
a highly significant process. It is this: As time
went on, Roman religious feeling quickly changed
in two almost opposite ways. On the one hand
it attached itself more and more to concrete and
material objects, and, on the other, its gods and
goddesses were felt less and less as living beings,
and more and more as mere abstract intellectual
“conceptions”. Yet these two changes were not really
opposite, but complementary. For as the visible part
of a goddess like Ceres became more and more solid,
as she came more and more to be used simply as a
synonym for <i>corn</i>, the invisible part of her naturally
grew more and more attenuated. Thus, the mythical
world was much less real to the Romans than it had
been to the Greeks. It was more like a world of
mental abstractions.</p>

<p>Soon there was a “god”, or part of a god, for every
object and every activity under the sun, and when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the empire was founded, each emperor, as he died,
automatically became a divinity. To-day the first
two “divine” emperors, <i>Julius</i> and <i>Augustus</i>, take
their places beside <i>Juno</i>, the Queen of Heaven, in
our monthly calendar. We may say, in fact, that
by the time Christianity began to spread in the Roman
Empire, Roman official religion had become divorced
from feeling altogether, its dry bones remaining little
more than a convenient system of nomenclature. Not
that the new religion had no serious rivals; but the
doctrines of Stoics and Epicureans, the Mystery
Schools, and cults such as that of Mithras, had little
historical connection with Roman mythology. Yet
if Rome contributed no discoveries of value concerning
the relations of human beings to the gods, it was
perhaps for this very reason that she was able to
concentrate more exclusively upon working out their
relations with each other; and in so doing she created
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>But in the later days of the empire, when this
attenuation of the imaginative and supernatural
element in Roman mythology had already gone beyond
its logical conclusion, when Rome had absorbed the
myths of Greece and Egypt and sterilized them both,
the soul of Europe was stirring afresh in the north.
Contact between the Roman tongue and that of their
subjects, the Celtic “Galli” in north Italy and beyond
the Alps, had grown more and more intimate.
Gradually there came into being a sort of hybrid
Low Latin, the father of modern French and the
other Romance languages, which in many cases
expressed Celtic notions and feelings in Latin forms.
So it was that new life came to be breathed into some
of the dead abstractions of Roman mythology; but
it was a very different life from the old one. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the old Roman deity Sors (Chance) had long ago
developed for the Romans into a purely abstract idea,
referring to the drawing of lots. But up in the north,
far away from the capital, the ‘sortiarius’ became
a mysterious teller of fortunes by that means. As the
years went on, the syllables softened and smoothed and
shortened themselves, until they became the old French
‘sorcier’ from which ‘sorcerie’ was formed, and so
our English <i>sorcery</i>. It is strange to think how far
this word has travelled from its origin; and in the
work of a modern poet we find it travelling even
farther, changing from a process into a sort of
mysterious realm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Heart-sick of his journey was the Wanderer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Foot-sore and sad was he;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a Witch who long had lurked by the wayside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Looked out of sorcery....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was much the same with ‘Fata’. For the Romans
themselves the old goddesses called the Fata, or
<i>Fates</i>, turned quickly into an abstracted notion of
destiny. But contact with the dreamy Celts breathed
new life into their nostrils, and ‘Fata’ in Late Latin
became spiritual once more. The sharp sounds were
softened and abraded until they slipped imperceptibly
into Old French ‘fée’ (Modern English <i>fay</i>), and so
<i>fa-ery</i> and <i>fairy</i>. <i>Demon</i> is the result of a similar
metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Now in dealing with mythology nothing is more
misleading than to compare the gods of different
nations, assuming that those who have etymologically
similar names meant the same thing to their worshippers.
For instance, it has been pointed out that
the name Tiu descends from a word which also
developed elsewhere into Dyaus and Zeus, but to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
suggest that Tiu was the “same god” as Zeus would
be quite meaningless. And it is the same with the
other persons of northern mythology, such as Thor,
the thunder-god, from whom we have <i>Thursday</i>, or
Wotan (Odin) who taught men language and gave
up his eye in order to possess his beloved Fricka
(<i>Wednesday</i> and <i>Friday</i>). There are many external
resemblances, etymological and otherwise, between
this Teutonic mythology and the mythology of Greece,
but for the historical study of human consciousness
it is the differences between them which are really
significant. Here there is no room to consider either
the resemblances or the differences, except in so far
as they are preserved for us in the words we use.
And we notice at once how small is the number of
our words which refer to the Teutonic myths. Where
relics still remain they seem to be either—like <i>elf</i>,
<i>goblin</i>, <i>pixy</i>, <i>puck</i>, <i>troll</i>—the names of the creatures
themselves, still used but no longer felt to exist, or
else—like <i>cobalt</i> and <i>nickel</i>, the names given by German
miners to demoniac spirits—they have lost all memory
of their original meaning.</p>

<p>There are, of course, exceptions, such as <i>Easter</i>, from
an old Teutonic goddess of the spring, <i>Old Nick</i> from
‘nicor’, a fabulous sea-monster, and <i>nightmare</i>
from the demon Mara, while the concepts <i>earth</i> and <i>lie</i>
(untruth) may possibly have been brought to birth
in men’s minds by the divinities Erda and Loki.
But compared with the number of derivations from
older myths these examples are practically negligible.
There is an accidental quality about them, and few
have entered very deeply into our language. The
Aryan family was now growing older and more firmly
knit. While Slavs, Teutons, and Celts were still
uncivilized, their cousins, the Greeks and Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
had already developed an elaborate culture. Had the
former been left alone like the latter, their mythology,
too, might in time have grown down into the language.
But that was not to be. The great Aryan family did
not lose touch long enough. When Rome came,
and with her Christianity, the missionaries naturally
assured the believers in Thor and Wotan that Thor
and Wotan were not. And coming, as they did, from
a developed civilization, they not only ousted the old
Teutonic gods from the language, but brought with
them a supply of ready-made Greek and Latin words,
many of which—did they but know it—drew their
peculiar shades of meaning from a pagan mythology
which they held in equal abhorrence. The classical
gods and goddesses faded so slowly into the thin air
of abstract thought that the process was hardly
perceived, but the Nibelungs and Valkyries, the
Siegfrieds and Fafnirs of Teutonic myth, were doomed
while they were still alive. Thus our fathers beheld
the death of Baldur with their own eyes, and were
awake during the twilight of the gods.</p>

<p>Of course, where the events of Teutonic myth and
legend were associated with a particular locality, they
have left their mark in the names of places. These,
naturally enough, are found for the most part in
Germany. In Great Britain—apart from <i>Asgardby</i>,
<i>Aysgarth</i>, <i>Wayland Smith</i>, <i>Wansdyke</i>, <i>Wednesbury</i>, and
some others—the place-names that have come to us
from pre-Christian religion are principally Celtic, and
are usually found—like <i>Cader Idris</i>, <i>Cader Arthur</i>,
<i>Arthur’s Seat</i>, <i>Kynance Cove</i>, ...—in Scotland, Wales,
and Cornwall. Apart from place-names, <i>galahad</i> is
a relic of Celtic legend which has found a permanent
place and a modern usage in the language; and there
may be one or two others. But not many. In England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
the whole Celtic nation and language died early
out of the common consciousness, and it died even
more suddenly than the persons of Teutonic myth.
This explains the freshness and delight which many
young writers of the last generation found in the
language and legend of Irish antiquity. To resuscitate,
as Keats did, the invisible beings of classical mythology
was to dig down into the roots of our present everyday
outlook; to take part in the Celtic revival was to feel
that you were looking out on the world through an
entirely new window—or at any rate through one
which had not been cleaned for centuries.</p>

<p>We only owe one English word to the Slavonic
myths, and that is the unpleasant <i>vampire</i>, which was
brought back from the East by travellers in the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The general relation between language and myth is,
as the word <i>myth</i> (Greek ‘muthos’—word) suggests,
almost unfathomable; but before leaving the limited
Aryan aspect, which is all we have had space to touch
on here, one interesting etymology ought to be mentioned,
which has sometimes been taken to conceal
the whole root and purpose of Aryan culture in the
history of mankind. The Hindoos look back to a
great teacher called Manu. Whether this individual
himself, or his name, is historical or mythical
is not particularly important. Hindoo sacred language
and literature reveal at any rate a prehistoric <i>belief</i>
among certain classes of society that Manu was
the originator of their culture and religion. Now
‘manu’ is also their word for <i>man</i>; and about this
word, as it appears in the different Aryan languages,
there are two interesting points. The first is that
wherever it crops up it bears the double meaning of
‘human being’ and ‘member of the male sex’;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the second that it is thought to be cognate with the
root ‘men’, implying ‘to think’, which appears also
in English <i>mind</i>, Latin ‘mens’,... We have seen
that to the external view one of the most remarkable
characteristics in which Aryans differed from the races
they supplanted was their patriarchal system. The
etymology of the word <i>man</i> suggests the inner reason
for this, for it hints at a dim consciousness among the
Aryans that the essential function of the human being—at
any rate of the Aryan human being—is to think.</p>

<p>Side by side with the conception of the human
being as a “thinker”, we find an instinctive feeling
that the human race is especially represented by its
male portion. To the Aryan outlook, wherever we
find it, the human being is <i>man</i>, and God is God the
Father. What exotic matriarchies may have held
sway before humanity began to worship logic and
masculinity we cannot say, for our language throws
light only on that tiny portion of humanity’s inner
and outer history which is the peculiar contribution
of the Aryan races; and, in doing so, it suggests
that, in spite of their tendency towards monogamy
and a rigid family organization, the “subjection” of
women has its roots very deep in Aryan psychology.
In this respect Greece and Rome differed but little in
essence from India and Persia. The impulse towards
a different conception of women, both in their own
minds and in the minds of men, which has been
giving an increasing amount of trouble to the European
races for the last two thousand years, was really, as
we shall see, implanted in the Aryan outlook by
foreign religions.</p>

<i>Quantity.</i> <i>Heresy.</i></p>

<p class="drop-capy">The difference between Greek and Roman
character, which is marked so plainly by the way
in which Aryan myths developed among the two
peoples and moulded the finer meanings of their
languages, is evident in many other English words
besides those which we can actually trace back to such
myths. For instance, the Greek ‘scandalizein’ and the
Latin ‘offendere’ both meant to ‘cause to stumble’,
but for us there is a subtle difference between <i>scandalize</i>
and <i>offend</i>; for while <i>scandalize</i> and <i>scandal</i>
merely hint at the liveliness of an emotion, <i>offend</i> and
<i>offence</i> convey a sober warning of its probable results.
‘Discere’ in Latin and ‘mathein’ in Greek both
meant to ‘learn’; but the substantives which are
derived from these verbs have come down into our
language, the one as <i>discipline</i> and the other as
<i>mathematics</i>. Rome turned instinctively to the external,
Greece to the inner world as a vehicle for the
expression of her impulses. And just as ‘learning’
for the Roman gradually came to mean ‘learning
to be a soldier’, so the ordinary Latin word for
‘teacher’ (doctor) is now applied most commonly to
a teacher of physical health. And these two are
not the only Latin words which have hurried out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
school in this way. ‘Magister’, for instance, has
exchanged the class-room for the police-court and left
behind the Greek ‘paidagόgos’ (pedagogue) to express
the most schoolmasterish kind of schoolmaster that
can be imagined. Perhaps the most significant of all
is <i>school</i> itself. Words for ‘teaching’ and ‘learning’
among the Romans inevitably came to express
unacademic ideas. When they did want a word for
academic processes they had to borrow it, like
‘schola’, from Greece. Yet, curiously enough, the
original meaning of ‘schole’ in Greek was not <i>school</i>
at all. What the Roman felt about the whole business
of book-learning and disputing and thinking and talking
philosophy is indeed conveyed to us clearly enough by
the meaning of the Latin ‘schola’, from which we
have taken <i>school</i>. But to a Greek all this had been
merely the natural way of spending his spare time.
‘Scholē’ was the common Greek word for ‘leisure.’</p>

<p>Now this insatiable appetite of the Greek mind for
thinking and philosophy is a phenomenon in the
history of the Western outlook as sudden and unaccountable
as the appearance of the Aryan peoples
on the stage of history. As far back as the seventh
or eighth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we find, side by side with the
popular Greek mythology, a developed and intricate
system of philosophy—a kind of language and thought,
in fact, which, as the labyrinthine history of our own
tongue is enough to show us, could not possibly have
sprung up in the night. And in their writings the
Greek philosophers themselves allude to sources from
which they may well have taken the seeds of abstract
thought. References are made as early as Pythagoras
and as late as Plato to the priestly wisdom of Egypt;
and when we remember that the time which elapsed
between the rise of Egyptian civilization and the birth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of Homer is about as long as the period between
Homer’s day and our own, we need not be surprised.
Moreover, we find some evidence of the debt to Egypt in
our language. Two almost indispensable prerequisites
for the development of philosophy are the art of
writing and something to write upon. It is interesting,
therefore, to observe that our word <i>alphabet</i> comes to us,
through Latin, from the first two letters in the Greek
alphabet—‘alpha’ and ‘beta’—which are themselves
in the first place Phoenician words. Greek mythology
looked back to Cadmus, a Phoenician, as the founder
of the alphabet, and it is now believed that the Semitic
Phoenicians did indeed bring writing into Greece, and
that they themselves took it from the ‘hieratic script’
or priestly writing of Egypt. <i>Jot</i>, in the phrase ‘jot
or tittle’, is an English form invented by the translators
of the Authorised Version for the Greek letter
‘iota’, which is also of Phoenician origin. <i>Bible</i>, on
the other hand, is from the Greek ‘biblos’, which
meant ‘the inner bark of the papyrus’, and so ‘a
book’; and <i>paper</i> was borrowed by the Angles and
Saxons from Latin ‘papyrus’, itself a transliteration
of the Greek ‘papuros’, meaning an Egyptian rush
or flag, of which writing material was made. Both
these words are thought to be of Egyptian origin.</p>

<p>External evidence tells us that already, a thousand
years before the Aryans began to move, Egypt had
mapped out the stars in constellations and divided the
zodiac into twelve signs, and we are told by Aristotle
that the Egyptians “excelled in mathematics”. But
if there was among the priests a “philosophy” in our
sense of the word, we know little of it—perhaps because
truth, unadorned by myth, was regarded in those days
as something dangerous, to be kept religiously secret
from all save those who were specially prepared to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
receive it. This idea of inner religious teachings,
guarded carefully from the ignorant and impure, survived
in great force among the Greeks themselves,
and we come across references in their philosophy to
institutions called <i>Mysteries</i>, which were evidently felt
by them to lie at the core of their national and
intellectual life. Thus that hard-worked little English
trisyllable, without which minor poetry and sensational
journalism could barely eke out a miserable
existence, has a long and dignified history, into which
we must pry a little farther if we wish to understand
how Greek thought and feeling have passed over into
our language.</p>

<p>We have adopted from Latin the word <i>initiate</i>,
which meant ‘to admit a person to these Mysteries’,
and the importance attached to secrecy is shown by
the fact that ‘muein’, the Greek for ‘to <i>initiate</i>‘,
meant originally ‘to keep silent’. From it the
substantive ‘mu-sterion’ was developed, thence the
Latin ‘mysterium’, and so the English word. The
secrets of the Greek Mysteries were guarded so
jealously and under such heavy penalties that we still
know very little about them. All we can say is that
the two principal ideas attaching to them in contemporary
minds were, firstly, that they revealed in
some way the inner meaning of external appearances,
and secondly, that the “initiate” attained immortality
in a sense different from that of the uninitiated. The
ceremony he went through symbolized dying in order
to be “born again”, and when it was over, he believed
that the mortal part of his soul had died, and that
what had risen again was immortal and eternal. Such
were the associations which St. Paul had in mind, and
which he called to the imaginations of his hearers,
when he made use of the impressive words: “Behold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
I tell you a mystery!” And it is the same whenever
the word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament and
in writings of that period, for it retained its technical
meaning and associations well on into the Christian
era.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The first man—as far as we know—to call himself
a ‘philosophos’, or lover of wisdom, was Pythagoras,
who applied the label to himself and his followers.
<i>Philosophy</i> among the Pythagoreans, with its emphasis
on astronomy, geometry, and number, was still
decidedly Egyptian; but gradually, from these starry
beginnings, the Greek mind built up a vast, independent
edifice of thought and language. The words that
have come into our language directly from Greek
philosophy are numerous enough, but if we were to
add those which have reached us in Latinized form,
and finally those words which are actually Latin, but
which take their whole meaning from the Greek thought
they were used to translate, we should fill several
pages with the mere enumeration of them. The list
would spread itself all over the dictionary, varying
from such highly technical terms as <i>homonym</i> and
<i>noumena</i> to common ones like <i>individual</i>, <i>method</i>, and
<i>subject</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more accurate term than Greek philosophy
would be “Greek thought”, for Greek thinkers took
some time to arrive at the distinction, so familiar to
us, between philosophy and other branches of study
such as history. The Greek word ‘historia’ meant
at first simply ‘knowledge gained by inquiry’, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
some of the words which follow are first found in the
works of Hesiod and Herodotus.</p>

<p>Among the words which have come to us from
earlier Greek thought are <i>cosmos</i><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>—the name applied
by the Pythagoreans to the universe, which they
perceived as a “shapely” and harmonious whole—geometrical
terms such as <i>pyramid</i> (probably of
Egyptian origin), <i>hypotenuse</i> and <i>isosceles</i>; many of
the technical terms of music, as <i>chord</i>, <i>harmony</i>,
<i>melody</i>, <i>tone</i>; of literature: <i>hyperbole</i>, <i>metaphor</i>,
<i>rhetoric</i>, <i>syntax</i>, <i>trope</i>; and a host of common words
of wider significance, such as <i>academy</i>, <i>analogy</i>,
<i>aristocracy</i>, <i>astronomy</i>, <i>cosmogony</i>, <i>critic</i>, <i>democracy</i>,
<i>eclipse</i>, <i>economic</i>, <i>enthusiasm</i>, <i>ethical</i>, <i>genesis</i>, <i>grammatical</i>,
<i>hypothesis</i>, <i>mathematical</i>, <i>method</i>, <i>phenomenon</i>,
<i>physical</i>, <i>poetic</i>, <i>politics</i>, <i>rhythm</i>, <i>theology</i>, <i>theory</i>. Of
those which were translated into Latin by Cicero and
other Latin writers, and possibly by Greek schoolmasters
in Rome, we may mention <i>air</i>, <i>element</i>,
<i>essence</i>, <i>ideal</i>, <i>individual</i>, <i>quality</i>, <i>question</i>, <i>science</i>,
<i>species</i>, and <i>vacuum</i>, together with most of the terminology
of grammar, such as <i>adjective</i>, <i>case</i>, <i>gender</i>,
<i>noun</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>verb</i>,... <i>Type</i> comes from ‘tupos’,
the name of the preliminary sketch made by a Greek
painter before he started on the work itself.</p>

<p>In a sense, the thought of the earlier Greek philosophers
may be said to have reached its consummation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
its very fullest expression, in the writings of Plato.
Among the words which are first found in his works
are the Greek originals of <i>analogy</i>, <i>antipodes</i>, <i>dialectic</i>,
<i>enthusiasm</i>, <i>mathematical</i>, <i>synthesis</i>, and <i>system</i>;
while he imparted a new and special meaning
to many others like <i>method</i>, <i>musical</i>, <i>philosopher</i>,
<i>sophist</i>, <i>theory</i>, <i>type</i>, <i>irony</i> (the name he gave to
Socrates’s peculiar method of simulating ignorance in
order to impart knowledge), and, of course, <i>idea</i> and <i>ideal</i>.
Before Plato used it, the word ἰδέα meant simply
the form or semblance of anything. It is connected
with ‘idein’, ‘to see’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, and when Cicero came to
translate it, he had to use the Latin word ‘species’,
which had a similar meaning, being connected with
‘specere’, ‘to see’ and ‘speculum’, ‘a mirror’.
To-day <i>idea</i> does not mean to us quite what ἰδέα did
to Plato; but tracing the whole history of the word,
we can see how it was Plato who, by his creative use
of these four letters, began to make it possible for
us to get outside our thoughts and look at them, to
separate our “ideas” about things from the things
themselves.</p>

<p>Thus, it was not only Greek words of which he was
to alter the meanings, nor only Greek and Latin words.
<i>Love</i> and <i>good</i>, for instance, are neither Greek nor Latin,
and <i>beauty</i> is only Latin remotely, yet the spirit of Plato
really works more amply in them, and in a thousand
others bearing on the presence or absence of these
qualities, than it does in such specifically Platonic terms
as <i>idea</i> and <i>dialectic</i>. Let us try and trace the origin
of some of the meanings which are commonly attached
to the word <i>love</i>. As in the Mysteries, so at the heart
of early Greek philosophy lay two fundamental
assumptions. One was that an inner meaning lay hid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
behind external phenomena. Out of this Plato’s lucid
mind brought to the surface of Europe’s consciousness
the stupendous conception that all matter is but an
imperfect copy of spiritual “types” or “ideas”—eternal
principles which, so far from being abstractions,
are the only real Beings, which were in their place
before matter came into existence, and which will
remain after it has passed away. The other assumption
concerned the attainment by man of immortality.
The two were complementary. Just as it was only
the immortal part of man which could get into touch
with the eternal secret behind the changing forms of
Nature, so also it was only by striving to contemplate
that eternal that man could develop the eternal part
of himself and put on incorruption. There remained
the question of how to rise from the contemplation
of the transient to the contemplation of the eternal,
and, for answer, Plato and Socrates evolved that other
great conception—perhaps even more far-reaching in
its historical effects—that love for a sensual and temporal
object is capable of gradual metamorphosis into
love for the invisible and eternal. It is not only in
the New Testament and the Prayer Book, in the
<cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, Shakespeare’s <cite>Sonnets</cite>, and all great
Romantic poetry that the results of this thinking are
to be seen. Through the Church and the poets to
the dramatist and the novelist, and through them
to the common people—there is no soulful drawing-room
ballad, no cinema-plot, no day-dream novelette
or genteel text on the wall of a cottage parlour through
which, every time the hackneyed word is brought into
play, the authentic spirit of Plato does not peep for
a moment forlornly out upon us.</p>

<p>In the latter days of Plato’s life there came to the
“Academy” where he taught a young man from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Stagira, in Macedonia. His name was Aristotle, and
after he left Plato he became for a time the tutor
of Alexander the Great. In spite of their proximity
in time and space, the difference between Plato’s method
of thought and the Aristotelian or <i>peripatetic</i> system
can hardly be exaggerated. While Plato had concentrated
his intellectual effort on mapping out what
we should now call the “inner” world of human consciousness;
starting from the point of view of ancient
tradition and myth, and working outward; relating
his thoughts to one another in accordance, as it were,
with their own inherent qualities; and deducing the
sense-world from the spiritual world; Aristotle turned
to the acquisition of knowledge about the outer world
of matter and energy—that is to say, that part of the
world which can be apprehended by the five senses
and the brain. The two philosophers were alike in
their emphasis on the importance of cultivating
immortality—or rather of “immortalling” (for they
used a special verb which we have lost), but otherwise
there were few resemblances indeed. To Plato the
soul of the universe had seemed inseparable from his
own soul, and natural phenomena such as the
revolutions of the planets had interested him rather
as tangible, outward pictures of the life within that
soul. To Aristotle the world outside himself was
interesting more for its own sake. Plato had looked
up to “Ideas”—real Beings with an existence of their
own, which stood behind physical phenomena rather
than within them. Aristotle deliberately attacked
this doctrine, maintaining that the Ideas were
immanent; they could not have existed before visible
Nature, nor could they have any being apart from it;
and they could only be arrived at, he said, by investigating
Nature itself. When Aristotle laid down his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
pen after writing the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the word <i>idea</i>
had taken a long step towards its present meaning.</p>

<p>Thus in Aristotle’s imagination the two worlds,
outer and inner, met and came into contact in quite
a new way. The mind was, as it were, put at the
absolute disposal of matter; it ceased to brood on
what arose from within, and turned its attention
outwards. The result of this was, of course, an
enormous increase in the amount of knowledge concerning
the material processes of the outer world.
But that was not the first result. For, curiously
enough, the first result was a pronounced hardening
and sharpening of the mind’s own outlines. Struggling
to fit herself, as into a glove, to the processes of cause
and effect observed in physical phenomena, the mind
became suddenly conscious of her own shape. She
was astonished and delighted. She had discovered
<i>logic</i>. The actual Greek word ‘logic’ (ή λογική
τέχνη) is first found with its present meaning in
Cicero, but he is speaking of Aristotle; the thing
itself and the technique of it was the invention of
Aristotle, and it was Aristotle who first used the word
<i>syllogism</i> in its modern sense.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant of all those words which
are first found in Aristotle’s treatise on <i>Logic</i> is
<i>analytic</i>. Here is indeed a new word made to express
a new kind of thinking. <i>Energy</i>, <i>entelechy</i>, <i>ethics</i>,
<i>physiology</i>, and <i>synonym</i>, are further examples of words
which, as far as we know, were actually created by
Aristotle, while we owe <i>metaphysics</i> to the accident
of his having treated that subject after (‘meta’) his
treatise on <i>Physics</i>. <i>Axiom</i>, <i>category</i>, <i>mechanics</i>,
<i>organic</i>, <i>physics</i>, and <i>synthesis</i> are Greek words which
take their modern meanings chiefly from Aristotle;
but his emphasis on the concrete and his constant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
gravitation towards a kind of knowledge which might
turn out to be practically useful evidently made him
a favourite with the Roman mind. Consequently
many of his words have come down to us translated
into Latin. Among those which we can actually trace
are <i>absolute</i>, <i>actual</i>, <i>definition</i>, <i>equivocal</i>, <i>induction</i>,
<i>instance</i>, <i>moral</i>, <i>potential</i>, <i>property</i>, <i>quintessence</i>, <i>subject</i>,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
<i>substance</i>, <i>virtual</i>, and the grammatical term
<i>particle</i>; of the plentiful number which have flown
more indirectly from his mind we may mention <i>conceit</i>
and <i>concept</i>, <i>deduction</i>, <i>difference</i>, <i>experiment</i>, <i>principle</i>,
and <i>universal</i>. In <i>quantity</i> (a translation of the Greek
‘posotes’—‘how-muchness’—and seemingly formed by
Aristotle on the analogy of Plato’s ‘poiotēs’, from which
we have <i>quality</i>) we can perhaps see the beginning
of that interest in the <i>calculable</i> aspect of the objects
of the visible world from which the exact sciences have
arisen. The human mind had now begun to weigh
and measure, to examine and compare; and that
weighing and measuring has gone on—with intervals—for
twenty-three centuries.</p>

<p>Thus, Platonic philosophy fades from our view in
the person of Socrates, proving by <i>analogy</i> the
immortality of the soul of man and the soul of the
world; and the fatal chill has scarcely risen to his
heart when Aristotelian philosophy comes over the
horizon, vigorously investigating by <i>analysis</i> the structure
and composition of the body of man and the
body of the world. Thanks to his friendship with
Alexander, Aristotle himself had hitherto unparalleled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
opportunities for collecting information on every
conceivable subject. Knowledge, often inaccurate
enough, was garnered from the four quarters of the
civilized world, old manuscripts were edited and compared,
and, above all, Nature herself was observed in
a way which was quite new. After his death his
followers went on putting his methods into practice.
Side by side with the weighing and measuring went
naming. And so to the three or four hundred years
which followed we owe a good deal of the technical
terminology of our arts and sciences. It was at this
time, for instance, that botany first developed into
a science. Many of the names of our commonest wildflowers
can be traced back to writings of the period,
and the following examples are all taken from the first
half of the alphabet: <i>aconite</i>, <i>amaranth</i>, <i>balsam</i>, <i>balm</i>,
<i>box</i>, <i>calamint</i>, <i>celandine</i>, <i>cherry</i>, <i>chestnut</i>, <i>chicory</i>,
<i>germander</i>, <i>heliotrope</i>, <i>marjoram</i>, <i>melilot</i>. Moreover,
nearly all the technical terms of botany are Greek,
and though most of them, including the word <i>botany</i>
itself, were created later, writers of this period may
be said to have given the lead with such learned labels
as <i>calyx</i>, <i>perianth</i>, and <i>gymnosperm</i>.</p>

<p>When we are “dating” a word in this way, however,
we must remember that only a fragment of the whole
of Greek literature has come down to us. Thus we
cannot be sure, because a flower-name first occurs in
a writer of the Alexandrian period, that it was actually
created by him or his contemporaries. <i>Anemone</i>,
<i>asparagus</i>, <i>bugloss</i>, <i>celery</i>, <i>centaury</i>, <i>clematis</i>, <i>coriander</i>,
<i>crocus</i>, <i>lily</i>, <i>medlar</i>, and <i>mint</i> all go right back to Classical
Greek, while <i>petal</i> and possibly <i>spore</i> are botanical
terms which were already in use. On the whole, the
Alexandrians probably collected, arranged, and renewed
the meanings of more words than they actually created.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>This is even truer in the case of medicine. The
<i>analytical</i> method of thought led naturally in Alexandria
to the actual dissection of bodies, living and dead.
Aristotle himself is still regarded as the founder of
comparative <i>anatomy</i> (cutting up), and it was he
who first used this word in its medical sense. The
peculiar meaning of the word <i>empirical</i>, moreover,
derives from a set of physicians who held that practice
was the one thing necessary in their art. It might
be thought that with this foreshadowing of modern
“methods” there would have been a great influx of
new information and new terminology. In actual fact
we find that the Greek words (and their name is legion)
in the terminology of medical science were either
created later by the different European peoples, or
else they appear in the works of Hippocrates, a
physician who had a large practice in Attica before
Plato was born. Among the words found in Hippocrates
are the Greek originals of <i>arthritis</i>, <i>bronchial</i>,
<i>catalepsy</i>, <i>catarrh</i>, <i>diarrhoea</i>, <i>dropsy</i>, <i>dysentery</i>, <i>epidemic</i>,
<i>erysipelas</i>, <i>haemorrhage</i>, <i>hypochondriac</i>, <i>hysteria</i>,
<i>nephritis</i>, <i>ophthalmia</i>, <i>paregoric</i>, <i>phlebotomy</i>, <i>phthisis</i>,
<i>quinsy</i>, <i>rheum</i>, <i>sciatica</i>, and <i>hypochondriac</i>; while
<i>apoplexy</i> is particularly interesting because its Latin
translation, ‘sideratio’, shows that it originally had
the sense of ‘star-struck’ or ‘planet-struck’. <i>Crisis</i>
is Hippocrates’s name for the crucial point at which
a disease takes a turn for the worse or the better.
It came to England with this meaning in the sixteenth
century, and was gradually extended to cover first
“the conjunction of stars on which this ‘crisis’
depended”, and then “any critical situation”.
<i>Anaemia</i>, however, and possibly <i>enteric</i>, seem to have
been first used by Aristotle.</p>

<p>The centre of all this furious intellectual activity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
was the city of Alexandria. Nor was it confined to
scientific spheres; for the results of religious and
philosophical developments which now took place in
and around the cosmopolitan city in the north of
Egypt were, if anything, more far-reaching than those
of empirical science. Indeed, it was from this point
in history that theology and science first<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> began to
be two separate studies, science following eagerly in
the footsteps of Aristotle and religion brooding over
the profundities of Platonic philosophy and saturating
them with feeling. Between Aristotle and Plato is
the great divide from which flowed in two different
directions two separate streams, as it were, of human
outlook; and just as the modern European, whether
or no he possesses any genuine scientific knowledge,
can trace the general shape and method of his thinking
back to the former, so, whether or no he calls himself
a Christian, he must trace much of what he regards
as his ordinary “feelings” back to the latter.</p>

<p>For the stream of Platonic thought was now to join
itself with other influences coming, for the most part,
from farther East. One of the few Egyptian words
which have come down into our language is <i>ammonia</i>.
It is the name of an alkali which was said to have been
found near a certain spot in the Libyan desert, where
there was an Egyptian temple to Zeus Ammon, and
it will serve to remind us that Alexander the Great
was deeply under the influence of the Egyptian priesthood
when, in 332 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, after his brilliant career of
conquests, he visited this temple to pay his devotions
before founding the city of Alexandria. We find,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
therefore—as might be expected—a strong Egyptian
element blending with what was Greek in the thoughts
and feelings that began to ferment in the more enterprising
Alexandrian bosoms. And that is not all. A
third influence was added. In the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
a certain capable ruler of Alexandria invited a body
of Egyptian Jews to translate the Hebrew Scriptures
into Greek. The Septuagint, as it was called, was
so successful that Greek soon became the official
language of the Hebrew religion. Thus, the Greek
version found its way into the synagogues of Palestine,
and it must have been the Greek version which was
read by Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>Without making a study of the Septuagint, it is
easy to perceive how passionate Hebrew meanings were
gradually imported into the cold and clear-cut Greek
words, until classical Greek had grown slowly into
the “Hellenistic” Greek of the New Testament.
Seeking for words to convey such notions as ‘sin’,
‘righteousness’, ‘defilement’, ‘abomination’, ‘ungodly’,
the Jewish translators had to do the best
they could with vocables which to Heraclitus and
Plato had implied something more like ‘folly’,
‘integrity’, ‘dirt’, ‘objectionable practice’, ‘ignorant’.
Any number of such examples could be
found. The harmless Greek word ‘eidōlon’ (<i>idol</i>),
which had formerly meant any sort of mental image,
including a mere mental fancy, suddenly found itself
selected from its fellows to be spit upon and cast
into outer darkness. ‘Paradeisos’, on the other
hand—the park of a Persian nobleman—was spirited
away, as though by the four Djinns of Arabian legend,
first to the Garden of Eden and then to the heavens.
It may well be that in the Septuagint version of the
Old Testament, more than anywhere else, is crystallized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
out for us that process which went on in and
about Alexandria for three or four hundred years,
and which remained almost unaffected by the inclusion
of the city within the Roman Empire. Language
never ceases growing, but an important document
such as this is like a cross-section of its stem. In
it we can see clearly what an enormous part that
Alexandrian mingling of Jewish, Egyptian, and Greek
conceptions of the Almighty has played in determining
the subtler part of the words we use every day—in
building up those delicate associations of which few
of us ever become fully conscious, but which we all
instinctively bring into play when we are speaking
under the influence of emotion.</p>

<p>And later, in the work of a writer like Philo the
Jew, who lived and wrote about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 50, we can
discern some of the religious activities which had
followed the translation of the Septuagint; how the
Jew, with his expectation of the Messiah, the Egyptian
devotee, with his reverence for Horus—the child of
a virgin mother, Isis—who died and rose again as
the sun-god Osiris, and the Greek, with his elaborated
Platonic doctrine, met together, speaking Greek; how
innumerable sects, ascetic and licentious, philosophical
and superstitious, wise and foolish, had been springing
up and dying down all over the Alexandrian world—all
of them, to whatever extravagant lengths they may
have carried their philosophies and their dreams,
working unconsciously at the long task of altering
the meaning, the emotional colour, the evocative
power of common Greek words. Concepts such as
‘God’, ‘world’, ‘love’, ‘soul’, ‘life’, ‘death’,
‘spirit’, ‘self’, and a hundred others were first
resolved by the chemical action upon them of similar
concepts from the minds of other nations and races,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and then they began to be built up anew and to
take on the form in which they are presented, as
he learns to speak, to the modern European child.</p>

<p>Greek philosophy had developed in many directions
since Plato’s day. We hear of <i>Cynics</i>, <i>Sceptics</i>,
<i>Epicureans</i>, <i>Stoics</i>, all of which words originated as
the names of different schools of philosophy. The last
two, whose doctrines were to take such a firm hold
on the educated classes of imperial Rome, have given
us one or two important words. Apart from their
moral teachings, they appear to have directed their
philosophical inquiries more especially to the point
of contact between thoughts and things or, as we
should say, between objective and subjective. ‘Phantasia’,
from which we have <i>fantasy</i> and <i>fancy</i>, was a
popular word with the Stoics, who gave it much of
its modern meaning; <i>notion</i> and <i>comprehension</i> are
Cicero’s translations of Stoic terms; while <i>image</i> in
the sense of ‘mental image’ and <i>spectre</i> are Latin
renderings of Epicurean expressions. Epicurus had
founded his doctrines on those of Democritus, and
these last two words were employed by Cicero and
one of his friends in discussing that philosopher’s odd
theory of perception. He had held that the surfaces
of all objects are continually throwing off ‘images’—a
kind of films or husks which float about in space
and at last penetrate to the mind through the pores
of the body. Both the Stoic ‘phantasia’ and this
Democritan word ‘eidōlon’, which Cicero translated by
‘imago’, seem to have contributed a part of their
meaning to the later ‘imaginatio’, from which, of
course, we have taken our <i>imagination</i>.</p>

<p>It was the Stoics, too, who gradually burdened the
little Greek word ‘logos’ with the weight of a whole
metaphysical theory of the relation between spirit and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
matter. ‘Logos’ in Greek had always meant both
‘word’ and the creative faculty in human beings—‘Reason’,
as it is often translated—which expresses
itself by making and using words. The Stoics
were the first to identify this human faculty with that
divine Mind (Nous) which earlier Greek philosophers
had perceived as pervading the visible universe. They
were the first to make the progressive incarnation of
thought in audible sound a part of the creative working
of God in the world; and it is to them accordingly,
with their deep sense of the divine significance of
words and their origin, that we owe the word <i>etymology</i>,
the first half of which is composed of a poetical Greek
adjective meaning ‘true’. Though he had never
heard of Christianity, Philo, importing into the theory
a certain Semitic awfulness, actually called this
mysterious ‘logos’ the ‘only-begotten-son’.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the majority of
Alexandrian citizens were interested in these matters.
Israel and Egypt resembled Greece in this, that they
had in the first place their inner religious traditions,
and in the second their stock of popular myth and
legend. And just as, in Athens, the average citizen
had accepted the teachings of ordinary Greek
mythology, without knowing anything at all about
the thoughts of contemporary philosophy, so was it
in Alexandria, where the majority lived a life of easy-going
frivolity and dissipation, paying to the gods
the regular outward observances demanded by the
calendar, and otherwise not bothering to think much
about them until they were frightened or ill. Throughout
the course of history the many have accepted, as
far as they were able, the thoughts which have been,
made for them by the few in the past, and the few
have gone on constructing the opinion of the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>In Palestine Jesus of Nazareth lived and taught
and died. As the years passed by, an increasing
number of sages and religious teachers began to agree
among themselves that recently something had
actually occurred which had before only been talked
about or erroneously believed to have occurred.
Certain of the Jews, for instance, admitted that their
Messiah had now come and gone. Egyptians and
followers of the Egyptian cults were persuaded that
a real Horus had been born of a virgin, and had risen
again as an Osiris. Some of the more forward-looking
among those who had been initiated into the Mysteries
felt that what had so often been enacted dramatically
within the sacred precincts had now taken place in
a peculiar way on the great stage of the world, this
time not for a few, but for all to see. A God had
himself died in order to rise again to eternal life.
Thus, those who had not been initiated—the poorer
classes, most of the women, and the slaves—had a
joyous feeling that at last the Mysteries had been
revealed, that “many things which were hid had been
made plain”. And some students of Platonic philosophy
could admit that this might be true, that
henceforth those who could not rise to the contemplation
of the eternal in Nature might yet win
immortality by contemplating the life and death of
Jesus. For they could see in Christ one who had
first taught in a new and simpler way, and had then
Himself demonstrated, a truth which nearly every one
of the Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, had
been trying to say all their lives—that, in order to
achieve immortality, it is necessary to “die” to this
world of the senses and the appetites, and that he
who thus “dies” is already living in eternity during
his bodily life and will continue to do so after his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
bodily death. “Whosoever shall lose his life shall find
it.” Lastly, followers of Philo and his school saw in
the Christ the Logos itself incarnate in human form,
the Word made Flesh.</p>

<p>Such were some of the numerous ideas and emotions
which had become embedded in the Greek language
by the time that, somewhere about a hundred years
after His death, the life of Christ was written by the
four Evangelists and others. Out of these ideas and
emotions arose, in the first place, the dogma and ritual
of the Catholic Church, and in the second place a great
part of the ordinary thoughts and feelings and
impulses of will which flourish in the bosoms of modern
Europeans and Americans.</p>

<p>Very early in its career the leaders of the infant
Church must have realized two things—firstly, that
those who, like the Gnostics, were passionately
interested in philosophical and mystical interpretations
of the life of Christ, not only differed very widely
among themselves, but also often paid little attention
to that personal life of Jesus, as recorded in the
Gospels, whose sweetness was beginning to bind men
together with marvellous new ties; secondly, that the
simple and ignorant people to whom, according to
the Gospels, Jesus addressed Himself almost exclusively,
would be quite incapable of grasping these interpretations.
If Christianity was to spread, it must be
simplified. For these reasons the leading spirits
gradually set their faces more and more rigidly against
those long and laboriously evolved ideas which had
actually created the language of the Gospels. And
no doubt there were other reasons too: the most
shocking immorality was rampant everywhere, and
in those days opinion and behaviour were more closely
bound up with one another. Moreover, in all but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
strongest natures an extreme love of moral purity is
often accompanied by an extreme love of exerting
authority.</p>

<p>Therefore incredibly industrious Fathers busied
themselves in editing and selecting from the literature
and traditions of a hundred semi-Christian sects.
Doctrines which had taken a very strong hold on many
imaginations were accepted, given the orthodox stamp,
and incorporated in the canon; others were rejected,
and, being pursued at first with a mixture of genuine
logic, misrepresentation, and invective, and, as the
Church grew stronger, with active persecution, gradually
vanished away or dwindled down to obscure
apocryphal manuscripts, some of which have only
been partially translated within the last twenty-five
years. Thus, for more than ten centuries, creeds
and dogmas, to the accompaniment of immense intellectual
and physical struggles, were petrified into
ever clearer and harder forms. Christianity became
identified with Catholic doctrine, and, soon after the
Church’s authority was backed by that of the Roman
Empire, any other form of it might be punished by
death amid excruciating tortures. The stigma which
still attaches to the ordinary Greek word for ‘choosing’
(<i>heresy</i>) is a fair indication of the zeal with which the
early Popes and Bishops set about expunging from
the consciousness of Christendom all memory of its
history and all understanding of its external connections;
while their success may be judged from the
fact that as late as the last century an Englishman
of public position who should have openly interpreted
the Old Testament as Origen, for instance, interpreted
it in the third century, would have incurred serious
disabilities.</p>

<p>Consequently it is not surprising if we have found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
ourselves digging in somewhat unfamiliar places.
Later on, the Catholic outlook spanned the whole
imagination of the Middle Ages like the vaulted nave
of a vast cathedral. By laying bare some of the
foundations of that outlook and applying to them a
little knowledge of the histories of words and their
meanings, we can do something which we could hardly
do else but by a long and difficult study of the arcana
of the Dark Ages, their Neoplatonism, their monastic
traditions, their Schools, and their cults of the Virgin.
We can, in some degree, be present with our own
imaginations at the building of the cathedral. And
this is worth while, not only for its own sake, but
because, as that huge edifice slowly ruined, we filched
its worn but shapely stones and began to build up
with them those bridges of feeling which join us to-day
to our husbands and our wives, our children, our
lovers, our friends.</p>

<p>Plato, following the doctrines of Timaeus and Pythagoras,
taught also a moral and intellectual system of
doctrine, comprehending at once the past, the present, and
the future condition of man. Jesus Christ divulged the
sacred and eternal truths contained in these views to
mankind, and Christianity, in its abstract purity, became
the exoteric expression of the esoteric doctrines of the
poetry and wisdom of antiquity. The incorporation of
the Celtic nations with the exhausted population of the
south, impressed upon it the figure of the poetry existing
in their mythology and institutions. The result was a
sum of the action and reaction of all the causes included in
it; for it may be assumed as a maxim that no nation or
religion can supersede any other without incorporating
into itself a portion of that which it supersedes. The
abolition of personal and domestic slavery, and the emancipation
of women from a great part of the degrading
restraints of antiquity, were among the consequences of
these events.</p>

<p>... The freedom of women produced the poetry of
sexual love. Love became a religion, the idols of whose
worship were ever present. It was as if the statues of
Apollo and the Muses had been endowed with life and
motion, and had walked forth among their worshippers;
so that the earth became peopled by the inhabitants of a
diviner world. The familiar appearance and proceedings
of life became wonderful and heavenly, and a paradise was
created as out of the wrecks of Eden. And as this creation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
itself is poetry, so its creators were poets; and language
was the instrument of their art: <i lang="it">Galeotto fù il libro, e chi
lo scrisse.</i>—<span class="smcap">Shelley</span>: <cite>A Defence of Poetry</cite>.</p>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">Apuleius and other imperial writers have left
us a picture, gaudy and fascinating enough, of
the earlier centuries of the Roman Empire. In their
works the pomps and frivolities of that decaying
world pass in procession before our eyes; the tenuous
old Roman gods and goddesses rub shoulders in the
popular imagination, on the one hand, with powerful
relics of the Egyptian Mysteries, and on the other—already
in the second century—with full-blooded
medieval witches and demons; while the polite
scepticism and graceful dissipation of the educated
raises its eyebrows and shrugs its shoulders at the
credulous fervours of Christians and their numerous
fellow-cranks. There are only one or two common
English words which throw any direct light on this
period. <i>Martyr</i>, the Greek word for a ‘witness’,
and so ‘a witness to the truth’, tells its story of
the earlier days of the Church, as <i>heresy</i> of the
later. The name <i>Constantinople</i> has a double historical
significance. It bears the name of the first Roman
emperor who recognized Christianity as the established
religion of the empire, and it marks the removal in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 330 of the imperial capital from Italy to the
shores of the Bosphorus. That removal foreshadowed
the inevitable splitting up of the Roman Empire into
an eastern and a western half, a schism which survives
formally to-day in the difference between the
Greek and the Catholic Church. It may be called
the starting-point of European history.</p>

<p>For Christian Rome we can go to Gibbon’s <cite>Decline
and Fall</cite> and Kingsley’s <cite>Hypatia</cite>, while Merejkowski,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
in his <cite>Death of the Gods</cite>, has attempted to paint, in
addition, something of the <em>inner</em> surface of that world,
to depict the huge shadowy movements that were
taking place deep down in the wills and imaginations
of men. Powerful movements they must have been.
For now the meanings and associations of all those
Latin words which were subsequently to come into
our language in the various ways described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a> were being built up or altered, not only
by outstanding figures such as St. Jerome and St.
Augustine, and the lawyer Emperor Justinian, but
also by insignificant Roman legionaries and barbarian
private soldiers, by outlandish scholars and studious,
dreaming monks. In particular, an increasing number
of the profound and manifold concepts which had been
laboriously worked into the Greek language in the
manner suggested in the <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">last chapter</a> were gradually
decanted, either by actual translation or by more
indirect methods, into Latin syllables. Thus, side by
side with the Septuagint, there came into being the
Vulgate, a Latin translation of the Old and New
Testaments, finished by St. Jerome in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 405, and
still the received text of the Roman Catholic Church.
But it did not stand alone like the Septuagint. Many
volumes of ecclesiastical literature are extant through
which we could trace the gradual importation into the
Latin language of the new meanings. For example,
at the end of the second century—no doubt with the
object of distinguishing the Christian Mystery of
incarnation, death, and rebirth from its many rivals—Tertullian
fixed the Latin ‘sacramentum’ as the proper
translation of ‘musterion’ instead of ‘mysterium’,
which would probably have disappeared altogether
had not Jerome restored it to partial use. Thus
one word, as is often the case, split up into two,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
<i>sacrament</i> remaining within the Church to express,
among other things, part of the old technical meaning
of <i>mystery</i>, while <i>mystery</i> itself, freed from one half of
its associations, moved outside and quickly grew wider
and vaguer. ‘Passio’, the Latin word for <i>suffering</i>,
used in ecclesiastical literature for the death
of Jesus on the cross, gradually extended in a similar
way the scope of its pregnant new meaning, and we
find already in Tertullian a derivative ‘compassio’.
From Latin, largely through French, such new meanings
found their way into English, and it was these, as
we shall see, more than anything else which transformed
the country between the Norman Conquest
and the fifteenth century into something like the
England which we know to-day.</p>

<p>For if we omit the Dark Ages, and, turning suddenly
from the civilization of classical Greece and Rome,
raise the curtain on, say, thirteenth-century England,
we are struck by a remarkable transformation. An
attempt has been made in previous chapters to trace
the general changes of meaning in certain key-words
of human thought and feeling, such as <i>God</i> and <i>love</i>,
<i>life</i> and <i>death</i>, <i>heaven</i> and <i>hell</i>,... When we reach
medieval Europe, it is necessary to add a new class
of key-word altogether. Let us look at a fifteenth-century
English carol:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">Goddes mother be.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In such a poem we have once more a kind of cross-section
of the growth of European outlook. Between
its lines we seem to be able to hear, as in a dream,
the monotonous intonings of Egyptian priests, the
quiet words of Socrates in the Academy, and the alert
speculative hum of the Alexandrian world. It is so
graceful that for the moment it seems as though all
these things, with all the pillages and massacres and
crucifixions and vast imperial achievements of Rome,
had been conspiring together merely to load the
homely old Teutonic word ‘loaf-kneader’ with
new semantic significance, to transform it into that
mystery and symbol in the imaginations of men,
a <i>lady</i>.</p>

<p>The medieval lyric, as it gradually loses its exclusive
preoccupation with ecclesiastical subjects, becomes
more and more concerned with woman, and concerned
with her in a new way. Through the poetry
of Italy, where the Renaissance was already stirring,
the troubadour literature of France, and that
strange “Rose” tradition which is preserved to
us in Chaucer’s translation of the <cite lang="fr">Roman de la<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Rose</cite>, there grew up during the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries a small special vocabulary defining
the landmarks in that new region of the
imagination which the poets, and even the scholars,
of Europe were just discovering; we might call it
the region of devotional love. Indeed, it was more
than a vocabulary; it developed at one time into
a sort of miniature mythology, for the various conflicting
elements in a lady’s disposition which the
lover had to meet with and overcome were actually
personified, ‘Danger’ being a kind of mixture of
modesty and haughtiness—an ill-omened creature
whom ‘Pity’ or ‘Mercy’, if the lover was fortunate,
finally put to rout:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Al founde they Daunger for a tyme a lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet Pitee, thurgh his stronge gentle might</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Foryaf<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and made Mercy passen Ryght.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In these three lines from Chaucer’s <cite>Legend of Good
Women</cite> the four Anglo-French words <i>Danger</i>, <i>Pity</i>,
<i>Gentle</i>, and <i>Mercy</i> are all Latin terms whose forms
had altered, and whose meanings had received the
Christian stamp during the Dark Ages. <i>Pity</i> comes
from ‘pietas’ (compare <i>piety</i>); <i>gentle</i> from ‘gentilis’
meaning ‘of the same family’ and later ‘of noble
birth’; and <i>mercy</i> from ‘merces’, ‘a reward’, then
‘a reward in heaven for kindness displayed on earth’.
None of them—with the exception of <i>mercy</i> in its
theological sense—are known to have been used in
English before the thirteenth century. <i>Anguish</i>, <i>beauty</i>,
<i>bounty</i>, <i>charity</i>, <i>comfort</i>, <i>compassion</i>, <i>courtesy</i>, <i>delicate</i>,
<i>devotion</i>, <i>grace</i>, <i>honour</i>, <i>humble</i>, <i>passion</i>, <i>patience</i>, <i>peace</i>,
<i>purity</i>, <i>tender</i> are further examples of this new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
vocabulary of tenderness which came to us from Latin
through Early French. Some of them, such as <i>charity</i>,
<i>delicate</i>, and <i>passion</i>, were probably brought to England
by the preaching friars before the Conquest;
others came with the devout Normans, and did not
develop a secular meaning until after they had reached
our shores (<i>devotion</i> remaining purely theological until
as late as the sixteenth century); while yet a third
class had already been secularized by nimble spirits
like Petrarch and Ronsard a century or two before
they reached us by the Norman route along with more
frivolous terms, <i>amorous</i>, <i>dainty</i>, <i>dalliance</i>, <i>debonair</i>,
<i>delight</i>, <i>pleasure</i>, <i>pleasance</i>, and the like, in which there
is no particular reason to perceive a strong ecclesiastical
influence. All of them, apart from the last group, are
alike in that they started with a theological meaning
and subsequently developed an affectionate one alongside
of it. We may think of them as gifts presented
to the lyric lover by the Bride of Christ—well-chosen
gifts; for were they not the ardent creations of her
own early passion?</p>

<p>Thus, side by side with such lyrics as the carol
quoted above, we find in the Middle Ages charming
little secular poems almost indistinguishable from them
in tone and manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet rose of vertew and of gentilness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Delightsome lily of everie lustyness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Richest in bountie and in bewtie clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And everie vertew that is wened dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Except onlie that ye are mercyless.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Into your garth this day I did pursew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There saw I flowris that fresh were of hew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Both white and red most lusty were to seene</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And halesome herbis upon stalkis greene;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet leaf nor flowr find could I none of rew.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I doubt that Merche, with his cauld blastis keene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has slain this gentil herb, that I of mene;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose piteous death does to my heart such paine</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That I would make to plant his root againe,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So comforting his leavis unto me bene.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And along with the influx of Anglo-French words
further semantic changes were, of course, taking place
in the more important Old English words. If there
are occasions when a single word seems to throw more
light on the workings of men’s minds than a whole
volume of history or a whole page of contemporary
literature, the Middle English <i>love-longing</i> is certainly
one of them.</p>

<p>A new element had entered into human relationships,
for which perhaps the best name that can be found
is ‘tenderness’. And so—at any rate in the world
of imagination—children as well as women gradually
became the objects of a new solicitude. We do not
find in all literature prior to the Middle Ages quite
that <i>pathetic</i> sense of childhood which Chaucer has
expressed so delicately in the story of Ugolino of Pisa
in his <i>Monk’s Tale</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">But litel out of Pize stant<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> a tour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In whiche tour in prisoun put was he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with hym been his litel children three,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eldest scarsly fyf yeer was of age.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Allas, Fortune! it was greet crueltee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swiche briddes<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> for to put in swiche a cage!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Quotations are scarcely needed to intimate how such
colourless words as <i>little</i>—here sentimentally repeated—<i>children</i>,
and even <i>cruelty</i>, had gradually been laden
with fresh emotional significance by the Roman
Church’s worship of the baby Jesus and its popular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
expression in carol and drama. We still have a few
examples of these old Nativity Plays, from the
individual scenes of which we take the word <i>pageant</i>,
and about the same time that Chaucer wrote we know
that the tailors of Coventry composed and sang the
beautiful carol which begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lully, lullay, thou little tiny Child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By by lully, lullay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Herod the King</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In his raging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Charged he hath this day</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His men of might</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In his own sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All young children to slay....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus, when Tindale and Coverdale came to make their
translations of the Bible in the sixteenth century, they
found ready to their hand a vocabulary of feeling
which had indeed been drawn in the first place from
the austerities of the religious life, but which had in
many cases acquired warmer and more human echoes
by having been applied to secular uses. And just
as lyrical devotion to the Virgin Mary and to the
infant Jesus had evolved a vocabulary which could
express, and thus partly create, a sentiment of tenderness
towards all women and young children, so we
seem to feel the warmth of human affection, as it were,
reflected back into religious emotion in such creations
as Coverdale’s <i>lovingkindness</i> and <i>tender mercy</i>, Tindale’s
<i>long-suffering</i>, <i>mercifulness</i>, <i>peacemaker</i>, and <i>beautiful</i>
(for it was he who brought this word into general use),
and in many of the majestically simple phrases of the
Authorised Version.</p>

<p>In tracing the elements of modern consciousness
through the history of words in this way, there is one
mistake which it is especially important to avoid, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
that is the mistake of over-simplification. For instance,
just as it is true that the shade of feeling which we
call ‘tenderness’ can be traced back to the literature
of the Middle Ages, and that from there we can trace
it farther back still, through the Mariolatry of the
Roman Church to the opening chapters of the Luke
Gospel, and so to the old Egyptian Isis-worship and
the philosophy of Plato, so it is also true that it
can be understood more perfectly and felt more fully
when we have thus unravelled it. But not to realize
that with the appearance of a poetic tradition which
can give rise to such a poem as “I sing of a maiden”
something quite new, something with no perceptible
historical origin, enters into humanity, is to cultivate
a deaf ear to literature, and to mistake quite as
grievously both the method and the object of understanding
history.</p>

<p>If medieval Europe is cut off from Greece and Rome
by her imaginative conception of women, she is cut
off even more completely by her abstention from
slavery. Of this development, thus negatively stated,
there are few, if any, signs in our language; but traces
are by no means wanting of a certain deeper and
more interior change which must have underlain the
other two. Perhaps it can best be expressed as a new
consciousness of the individual human soul. On the
one hand the sense of its independent <i>being</i> and
activity, of bottomless depths and soaring heights
within it, to be explored in fear and trembling or with
hope and joy—with <i>delight</i> and <i>mirth</i>, or with <i>agony</i>,
<i>anguish</i>, <i>despair</i>, <i>repentance</i>—and on the other hand
that feeling of its being an <i>inner</i> world, which has
since developed so fully that this book, for example,
has fallen naturally into two halves.</p>

<p>In this connection it is particularly interesting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
note the appearance of <i>conscience</i> in the thirteenth
century. In classical times the Latin ‘conscientia’
seems to have meant something more like ‘consciousness’
or ‘knowledge’; it was generally qualified
by some other word (‘virtutum, vitiorum’—‘consciousness
of virtues, of vices,’ ...), and its termination,
similar to that of <i>science</i>, <i>intelligence</i>, ...
suggests that it was conceived of by the Romans more
as a general, <i>abstract</i> quality, which one would partake
of, but not actually possess—just as one has knowledge
or happiness, but not “a knowledge” or “a
happiness”. Used in ecclesiastical Latin and later
in English, <i>conscience</i> seems to have grown more and
more real, until at last it became that semi-personified
and perfectly private mentor whom we are inclined
to mean to-day when we speak of “my <i>conscience</i>”
or “his <i>conscience</i>”.</p>

<p>The movement towards “individualism”, like many
other phenomena of modern civilization, has long ago
shifted its centre of gravity outside the walls of the
Church. Once it was felt as the peculiar glory of the
Christian religion. In the Dark Ages heresies which
attempted to explain away the significant paradox of
Christ’s simultaneous divinity and humanity were
hunted down with the utmost rigour, and it is
probable that a vivid sense of the dignity of the
individual human soul was at the bottom of a good
many actions which now seem to us like the very
stultification of such a conviction. This great inner
world of consciousness, we may suppose, which each
individual was now felt to control in some measure
for himself, was a thing to fear as well as to
respect. It gave to every single soul almost infinite
potentialities, for evil as well as good; and even
the wisest heads seem to have felt that civilization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
could only be held together as long as all these souls
maintained a certain uniformity of pattern. Thus,
while the influence of Christianity had ensured to all
men—not merely to a small slave-owning class—a
modicum of personal liberty, it deprived them in
the same breath of that dearest of all possessions,
freedom of thought. The grim meaning gradually
acquired by the Latin word <i>Inquisition</i>, meaning
an ‘inquiry’, still signifies to us the ruthless
pains that were now taken, for the first time in
the world’s history, to pry into and endeavour to
control that private thinking life of men which had
suddenly acquired such a vast importance in their
eyes. The still grimmer <i>auto-da-fé</i> began life as a
Spanish phrase meaning simply an ‘act of faith’.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It seems remarkable to us that, in spite of this
active discouragement of independent thinking, the
Dark and Middle Ages were, beyond dispute, the cradle
of European philosophy. Perhaps this was because
men did not yet feel the need for such independence.
The leading quality of medieval thought was its
receptiveness, and towards the end of its life it seems
to have become almost conscious of this itself; for
it is hardly possible to open a volume of Chaucer
without lighting on some half-respectful, half-ironical
reference to “olde clerkes” or “olde bokes”. But
the profound respect in which the written word had
been held throughout the Middle Ages survives in
many other curious ways as well. We still use the
word <i>authority</i> in its two separate meanings of ‘a
quotation from a book’ and ‘the power of controlling’.
Of these the first meaning is the older,
and from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries it may
almost be said to have included the latter within it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Again, our word <i>glamour</i>, a later form of <i>gramarye</i>,
suggests an almost mystical reverence for the
‘grammar’ which—along with most of the other
branches of medieval learning—was derived entirely
from the works of Aristotle. The popularity and
general use of <i>term</i>, which began life as a subtle
technicality of Aristotelian logic, reminds us again of
the universal study of that writer in the Middle Ages,
and <i>spice</i>—a corrupted form of ‘species’—is but
another indication of the way in which the jargon of
classical philosophy crept into their everyday thought.</p>

<p>The change from Greek and Roman civilization to
the civilization of modern Europe is often represented
as having been more abrupt than it really was. We
have deduced some of the intermediate stages in the
alterations of feeling. In the world of thought there
are actual written documents for our information,
philosophical treatises and counter-treatises, which, by
revealing to us the very moment of impact, enable
us to trace more easily the reverberation of thought
from mind to mind. Very soon after the break up
of Rome, when the Empire was being partially re-organized
under Teutonic dynasties and the defunct
Latin <i>Caesar</i> rising again as the Germanic <i>Kaiser</i>, the
great medieval “Schools”, of which the most famous
was at Paris, began to arise out of the traditions of
monastic learning. Their classical library apparently
consisted of one Platonic dialogue and two or three
works of Aristotle, all of them translated; but the
authority of these translations was absolute. At first
Plato was considered the greater “authority”, but
from the beginning of the thirteenth century it seems
to have been accepted almost as a matter of course
that the one great object of all philosophy for all
time was the harmonization of Aristotelian logic and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Catholic dogma. But though the Aristotelian method
(as they understood it) was all in all, the actual
Platonic system, with the help of Neoplatonism and
the Mystics, lingered in sufficient strength to divide
medieval philosophy for several hundred years into
two rival camps. The one party, known as “Realists”,
held with Plato that “ideas”—now usually called
<i>universals</i>—had existed before, and could exist quite
apart from, things; while the “Nominalists” held
that universals had no separate or previous existence.
But as time passed, many of the Nominalists went
farther still, maintaining that these universals did not
exist at all, that they were mere intellectual abstractions
or classifications made by the human mind—in
fact “ideas” in the sense in which, owing to them,
we use the word to-day. One of the reasons—perhaps
the chief reason—why so many Schoolmen carried
Aristotle beyond himself in this way is a particularly
interesting one.</p>

<p id="ARA">Reference has already been made to the wave of
Arabic civilization which surged into Europe early in
the Dark Ages. It was a civilization in every sense
of the word; for in the ninth century learning had
developed under the Caliphs of Baghdad to a degree
unparalleled elsewhere in the world, and <i>rapprochements</i>
between the two races and civilizations, which
had already begun in the world of philosophy, were
soon strengthened and increased by those great
medieval experiments, the Crusades.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Now Arabic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
scholars were, if anything, more enthusiastic Aristotelians
than the scholars of Europe. The curious
word <i>arabesque</i>, and the fact that words like <i>algebra</i>,
<i>cipher</i>, <i>zero</i>, and some others to be mentioned in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">next chapter</a> are among the few Arabic words which
reached our language before the fourteenth century,
are both symptomatic of a certain peculiarity of the
Arabic mind which we may perhaps call the tendency
to abstraction. The Arab seems to have possessed
something of that combination of materialism on the
one hand and excessive intellectual abstraction on the
other which we have already noticed in the later stages
of Roman mythology. Just as he made Mohammedanism
out of the Jewish sacred traditions, so he made
Nominalism out of Greek philosophy. The influence
upon Christian thought of great Arabic philosophers
like Averroes and Avicenna is one of the most
astonishing chapters in its history. But it is not
difficult to see how it occurred. The learning of the
Middle Ages was founded entirely on translations, and
this was an activity in which, as far as Aristotle’s
works were concerned, the Arabs had got in first.
According to Renan, some of the current versions of
Aristotle were “Latin translations from a Hebrew
translation of a Commentary of Averroes made on an
Arabic translation of a Syriac translation of a Greek
text”.</p>

<p>To the Popes and those who had the power and
interest of the Church most at heart the problem
appeared in quite a different light. It was a question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
of steering Christian dogma between the Scylla of
pantheism and the Charybdis of materialism and its
logical conclusion, scepticism. Thus, throughout the
history of Scholasticism we have to do with a sort
of triangle of intellectual forces: Realism and
Nominalism fighting a five hundred years’ war, and
the Church, in its official capacity, anxiously endeavouring
to hold the balance between them. One
wonders whether the three parties to this ancient
dispute may not have found symbolic expression in
Tweedledum, Tweedledee, and the “Monstrous Crow”
of nursery legend. But it is no disparagement of the
intellects of that day to say that to us the chief
interest of their polemics lies in the many new and
accurate instruments of thought with which they
provided us. The common word <i>accident</i> is an
excellent example. We use it every day without
realizing that it was only imported from Latin by the
indefatigable efforts of the Schoolmen to reconcile the
doctrine of Realism with the Catholic dogma of Transubstantiation.
The <i>accidents</i>, when they first came
into the English language, meant that part of the
sacred bread and wine which remained after the
<i>substance</i> had been transmuted into the body and
blood of Christ.</p>

<p>On the whole it is a safe rule to assume that those
who speak most contemptuously of such thinkers as
Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus are the nearest
modern representatives of their own idea of what these
Schoolmen were; that is to say, they are those whose
imaginations are most completely imprisoned within
the intellectual horizon of the passing age. Much fun
has been made of medieval philosophy for discussing
such matters as how many angels can stand on the
point of a needle, and whether Christ could have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
performed His cosmic mission equally well if He had
been incarnated as a pea instead of as a man. The
growth of a rudimentary historical sense has, it is
true, made it fashionable lately to take these ancient
thinkers a little more seriously, but it is still the
rarest thing to find a philosopher or a psychologist
who fully comprehends that he is consuming the fruits
of this long, agonizing struggle to state the exact
relation between spirit and matter, every time he uses
such key-words of thought as <i>absolute</i>, <i>actual</i>, <i>attribute</i>,
<i>cause</i>, <i>concept</i>, <i>deduction</i>, <i>essence</i>, <i>existence</i>, <i>intellect</i>,
<i>intelligence</i>, <i>intention</i>, <i>intuition</i>, <i>motive</i>, <i>potential</i>, <i>predicate</i>,
<i>substance</i>, <i>tendency</i>, <i>transcend</i>; <i>abstract</i> and
<i>concrete</i>, <i>entity</i> and <i>identity</i>, <i>matter</i> and <i>form</i>, <i>quality</i>
and <i>quantity</i>, <i>objective</i> and <i>subjective</i>, <i>real</i> and <i>ideal</i>,
<i>general</i>, <i>special</i>, and <i>species</i>, <i>particular</i>, <i>individual</i>, and
<i>universal</i>. ‘Free will’ is the translation of a Latin
phrase first used by a Church Father, and ‘<span lang="la">argumentum
ad hominem</span>’ is an example of a scholastic idiom
which has remained untranslated. Many of these
words, it is true, are in the first instance Latin translations
of Greek terms introduced by pagan writers
before the days of the Schoolmen; some, like <i>quality</i>
and <i>species</i>, by Cicero himself, and others, like <i>accident</i>,
<i>actual</i>, and <i>essence</i>, by later Latin writers such as
Quintilian or Macrobius. But it must be remembered
that, even in these cases, the words, as we use them
to-day, are not <i>mere</i> translations. By their earnest
and lengthy discussions the Schoolmen were all the
time defining more strictly the meanings of these and
of many other words already in use, and so adapting
them to the European brain that in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries it was an easy matter for
the lawyers and for popular writers like Chaucer and
Wyclif to stamp them with the authentic genius of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
the English language and turn them into current coin.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Nobody who understands the amount of pain and
energy which go to the creation of new instruments
of thought can feel anything but respect for the
philosophy of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>If the philosophy of the Middle Ages is based on
the logic of Aristotle, their science can be traced rather
to the Greek thought of pre-Aristotelian times. For
authority it relied very largely on a single dialogue
of Plato, to which may be added Latin translations
of a small part of Hippocrates, and of his post-Christian
successor and interpreter, Galen. But the
way in which its terms have entered right into the
heart of our language is proof enough that this
medieval science arose, not merely from blind subservience
to tradition, but also from an actual survival
of the kind of feeling, the kind of outlook which,
ages ago, had created the tradition. In spite of that
strong and growing sense of the individual soul, man
was not yet felt, either physically or psychically, to
be isolated from his surroundings in the way that he
is to-day. Conversely his mind and soul were not
felt to be imprisoned within, and dependent upon, his
body. Intellectual classifications were accordingly less
dry and clear, and science—that general speculative
activity which a later age has split up into such categories
as astronomy, physics, chemistry, physiology,
psychology, ...—was as yet almost an undivided
whole. Common words like <i>ascendant</i>, <i>aspect</i>, <i>atmosphere</i>,
<i>choleric</i>, <i>common sense</i>, <i>complexion</i>, <i>consider</i>,
<i>cordial</i>, <i>disaster</i>, <i>disposition</i>, <i>distemper</i>, <i>ether</i>, <i>hearty</i>,
<i>humour</i>, <i>humorous</i>, <i>indisposed</i>, <i>influence</i>, <i>jovial</i>, <i>lunatic</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
<i>melancholy</i>, <i>mercurial</i>, <i>phlegmatic</i>, <i>predominant</i>, <i>sanguine</i>,
<i>saturnine</i>, <i>spirited</i>, <i>temper</i>, <i>temperament</i>, with
<i>heart</i>, <i>liver</i>, <i>spleen</i>, and <i>stomach</i> in their psychological
sense, most of which retained their original and literal
meanings down to the fourteenth century, give us
more than a glimpse into the relations between body,
soul, and cosmos, as they were felt by the medieval
scientist.</p>

<p>Thus, the physical body was said to contain four
<i>humours</i> (Latin ‘humor’, ‘moisture’)—<i>blood</i>, <i>phlegm</i>,
<i>bile</i> or <i>choler</i>, and <i>black bile</i> (melancholy)—which
last had its seat in the <i>hypochondria</i>. Not only
diseases, or <i>distempers</i>, but qualities of character were
intimately connected with the proper ‘mixture’
(Latin ‘temperamentum’) of these humours, just as
modern medical theory sees a connection between the
character and the glands. Thus, a man might be
good <i>humoured</i> or bad <i>humoured</i>; he might have a good
<i>temper</i> or a bad <i>temper</i>; and according to which <i>humour</i>
predominated in his <i>temperament</i> or <i>complexion</i>, he was
<i>choleric</i>, <i>melancholy</i>, <i>phlegmatic</i>, or <i>sanguine</i>. His
character depended on other things as well; for the
medieval scientist believed with Hippocrates that the
<i>arteries</i> (Greek ‘aēr’, ‘air’) were ducts through which
there flowed, not blood, but three different kinds of
<i>ether</i> (Greek ‘aithēr’, ‘the upper air’) or <i>spirits</i> (Latin
‘spiritus’, ‘breath’, ‘life’), viz. the <i>animal</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> (Latin
‘anima’, ‘soul’), the <i>vital</i>, and the <i>natural</i>. But the
stars and the planets were also living bodies; they
were composed of that ‘fifth essence’ or <i>quintessence</i>,
which was likewise latent in all terrestrial things, so
that the character and the fate of men were determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
by the <i>influences</i> (Latin ‘influere’, ‘to flow in’)
which came from them. The Earth had its <i>atmosphere</i>
(a kind of breath which it exhaled from itself); the
Moon, which was regarded as a planet, had a special
connection with <i>lunacy</i>, and according as the planet
Jupiter, or Saturn, or Mercury was <i>predominant</i> or in
the <i>ascendant</i> in the general <i>disposition</i> of stars at a
man’s birth, he would be <i>jovial</i>, <i>saturnine</i>, or <i>mercurial</i>.
Finally, things or persons which were susceptible to
the same <i>influences</i>, or which <i>influenced</i> each other in
this occult way, were said to be in <i>sympathy</i> or <i>sympathetic</i>.</p>

<p><i>Test</i> is an alchemist’s word, coming from the Latin
‘testa’, an earthen pot in which the alchemist made
his alloys. The same word was once used as a slang
term for ‘head’, and in its French form, ‘tête’, still
retains that meaning. The phrase <i>hermetically sealed</i>
reminds us that alchemy, known as the ‘hermetic art’,
was traced back by its exponents to the mysterious
Hermes Trismegistus, who himself took his name from
the Greek messenger-god Hermes. Other alchemists’
words are <i>amalgam</i>, <i>alcohol</i>, <i>alembic</i>, <i>alkali</i>, <i>arsenic</i>, and
<i>tartar</i>. The last five, together with the word <i>alchemy</i>
itself, all come to us from Arabic, and are evidence of
the fact that the Arabs of the Dark Ages, besides being
philosophers, were the fathers of modern chemistry.
It was, indeed, they who first joined the study of
chemistry to the practice of medicine, and thus
initiated a science of drugs. Moreover, that old
‘humoral’ pathology which has shaped so many of
our conceptions of human character—in so far as it
was based on ancient authority and tradition—came
from Hippocrates to Europe, for the most part not
directly, but by way of Baghdad and Spain.</p>

<p>The more intimate and indispensable such conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
are, the more effort does it require from the
twentieth-century imagination to realize how they
have grown up. It is so difficult, even when we are
reading contemporary literature, to blot out from
our consciousness the different meanings which have
since gathered round the words. If, however, we
can succeed in doing this, we cannot but be struck
by the odd nature of the change which they have
all undergone. When we reflect on the history of
such notions as <i>humour</i>, <i>influence</i>, <i>melancholy</i>, <i>temper</i>,
and the rest, it seems for the moment as though
some invisible sorcerer had been conjuring them all
inside ourselves—sucking them away from the planets,
away from the outside world, away from our own
warm flesh and blood, down into the shadowy realm
of thoughts and feelings. There they still repose;
astrology has changed to astronomy; alchemy to
chemistry; to-day the cold stars glitter unapproachable
overhead, and with a naïve detachment mind
watches matter moving incomprehensibly in the void.
At last, after four centuries, thought has shaken herself
free.</p>

<p class="p1b pfs90"><i>Zenith.</i> <i>Law.</i> <i>Investigate.</i> <i>Conceit.</i> <i>Gentleman.</i> <i>Love.</i>
<i>Protestant.</i></p>

<p class="drop-capy">Philosophy, alchemy, and mathematics were
not the only branches of learning in which the
Arabs had excelled. The appearance in English of
such words as <i>azimuth</i>, <i>nadir</i>, and <i>zenith</i> towards the
end of the fourteenth century suggests among other
things that the thinking of this Syrian race contributed
in no small degree to the rise in Europe of
the new astronomy. These three Arabic words (two
of them for the first time in English) are to be found
in Chaucer’s <cite>Treatise on the Astrolabe</cite>, written in 1391
for the instruction of his little son, “Lowis”; and
this interesting document contains many other words
also for which the <cite>Oxford Dictionary</cite> does not give
any earlier quotation, such as <i>almanac</i>, <i>ecliptic</i>, <i>equinox</i>,
<i>equator</i>, <i>horizon</i>, <i>latitude</i>, <i>longitude</i>, <i>meridian</i>, <i>minute</i>
(meaning one-sixtieth of a degree), while <i>zodiac</i> was
used by Gower a few years before.</p>

<p>Such words show us that the Europe of the Dark
Ages had been experiencing once more what the ancient
scientists had known. Its learned men had been
marking down recurrences of natural phenomena
and orientating themselves on the earth by dividing
its face up into imaginary rings and segments. For
such purposes they had found Latin and Greek terms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
ready to their hand, and the survival of the Greek
<i>zodiac</i> reminds us that they had, moreover, adopted
the ancient system of mapping out the heavens into
twelve “signs.” When, therefore, we find three
Arabic words among these relics of classical wisdom,
we need not be surprised to see that they express
something which the ancients had, apparently, never
felt the need of expressing—that is, an abstracted
geometrical way of mapping out the visible heavens.
These are conceived of as a vast sphere encircling the
earth; the <i>zenith</i> and the <i>nadir</i> are its poles, while
the <i>azimuths</i> <ins class="corr" id="tn-129" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'are meridans of'">
are meridians of</ins> celestial longitude.</p>

<p>It is probable that, with the use of these words, there
came for the first time into the consciousness of man
the possibility of seeing himself purely as a solid
object situated among solid objects. Of course, the
Arab astronomer of the Dark and Middle Ages still
saw the earth as the centre round which the universe
revolved, and he would no more have dreamed of
doubting the “astral” quality of the planets than
the schoolmaster of to-day who instructs his pupils
to write down “Let <i>x</i> = 20 oranges” doubts whether
oranges have any taste. Nevertheless we may feel
pretty sure that those minds which were apparently the
first to think of cutting up the sky without reference to
the constellations, and which could, moreover, develop
so fully the great and novel system of abstraction
which they called <i>algebra</i>, did their part in bringing
about that extraordinary revolution in astronomical
thought which is associated with the name of Copernicus.
It is true that the astronomy of Plato’s time
had been intimately connected with arithmetic and
geometry; but Plato’s “number” and his geometry
do not appear to have been quite the abstract sciences
which these things are to-day. What we call their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
“laws” seem to have been felt, not as intellectual
deductions, but rather as real activities of soul—that
human soul which, as we saw, the philosopher could
not yet feel to be wholly separate from a larger world
Soul, or planetary Soul. The Zodiacal signs, for
instance, had been as much, if not more, classifications
of this Soul as they had been sections of space. The
word comes from the Greek ‘zōdion’, a little animal,
and not only was every sign distinguished by a constellation,
of which the majority were associated with
some beast, but human character and human destiny
were believed to be bound up inextricably with the
position of the sun and the planets among these
signs.</p>

<p>If, therefore, there is any truth in the belief of the
old Greek philosophers and of some modern historians
that the study of mathematics has its origin in the
observed movements of the stars, the progress is of
the same nature as that which we noticed at the end
of the <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">last chapter</a>. Is it too fanciful to picture to
ourselves how, drawn into the minds of a few men,
the relative positions and movements of the stars
gradually developed a more and more independent
life there until, with the rise in Europe first of trigonometry
and then of algebra, they detached themselves
from the outside world altogether? And then by a
few great men like Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton,
these abstract mathematics were re-fitted to the stars
which had given them birth, and the result was
that cosmogony of infinite spaces and a tiny earth in
which our imaginations roam to-day? When the
Aryan imagination had at last succeeded in so
detaching its “ideas” about the phenomena of the
universe that these could be “played with,” as
mathematicians say, in the form of an equation, then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
no doubt, it was a fairly easy matter to turn them
inside out.</p>

<p>The alterations wrought in the meanings of many of
our common words by this revolution of physical
outlook are not difficult to perceive and yet not easy
to realize. As the discoveries of Kepler and Galileo
slowly filtered through to the popular consciousness,
first of all simple words like <i>atmosphere</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>earth</i>,
<i>planet</i>, <i>sky</i>, <i>space</i>, <i>sphere</i>, <i>star</i>, <i>up</i>, ... underwent a
profound yet subtle semantic change. And then, in
the eighteenth century, as Newton’s discoveries became
more widely known, further alterations took place.
<i>Weight</i>,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> for instance, acquired a new significance,
differing from <i>mass</i>, which also changed, having
formerly meant simply a lump of matter.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i>Gravity</i>,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
(from the Latin ‘gravitas’ ‘heaviness’) took on its
great new meaning, and the new words <i>gravitation</i>
and <i>gravitate</i> were formed, the later being soon adapted
to metaphorical uses. If we cared to examine them
closely enough, we should probably find that from this
point a certain change of meaning gradually spread over
all words containing the notion of attraction, or ideas
closely related to it. The twin phenomena of gravitation
and magnetism, contemplated by most of us at
an early age, and impalpably present in the meanings
of so many of the words we hear spoken around us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
make the conception of one lifeless body acting on
another from a distance easy and familiar.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But the
very word <i>attraction</i> (from the Latin ‘ad-trahere’, ‘to
draw’ or ‘drag towards’) may well serve to remind us
that until the discovery of gravitation this conception
must have been practically beyond the range of human
intellection. There was formerly no half-way house
in the imagination between actual dragging or pushing
and forces emanating from a living being, such as
love or hate, human or divine, or those “influences”
of the stars which have already been mentioned.</p>

<p>A good illustration of this fact—and one which takes
us back again to the seventeenth century—is the word
<i>law</i>. The Latin ‘lex’ was first applied to natural
phenomena by Bacon. Later in the century <i>law</i>
was used in the same sense, but it did not then mean
quite what it does to-day. The “laws of Nature”
were conceived of by those who first spoke of them
as present commands of God. It is noticeable that
we still speak of Nature “obeying” these laws, though
we really think of them now rather as abstract principles—logical
deductions of our own which we have arrived
at by observation and experiment.</p>

<p>Some account of Francis Bacon’s general influence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
as a writer, on our language has already been given in
<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>. His influence on thought was far greater,
for he was in some sense the moving spirit of that
intellectual revolution which began to sweep over
Europe in the sixteenth century. It was a revolution
comparable in many ways to the change inaugurated
by Aristotle twenty centuries earlier, and there is
accordingly much in Bacon’s work that reminds us
of the Greek philosopher. To begin with, he was
thoroughly dissatisfied with the whole <i>method</i> of
thought as he found it in his day, and, like Aristotle,
he strove first of all to effect a reformation in this.
Aristotle had written the <cite lang="la">Organum</cite>—that is to say,
the “Instrument” (of Thought)—and Bacon intended
his <cite lang="la">Novum Organum</cite> to go one step farther. He
proclaimed himself satisfied with Aristotle’s legacy—the
prevailing logical system of syllogism and deduction—as
far as it went. Given the “premises,” it
was the correct line of further discovery. What he
questioned was the Scholastic premises themselves,
and he propounded accordingly a new and surer method
of establishing fresh ones. It is known as the “inductive
method.” This is not the place to expound
Bacon’s logical system, and it will suffice that it was
based on an extensive and, above all, a systematic
observation of Nature herself. Aristotle had indeed
(though the Schoolmen had nearly forgotten it) pointed
the way to such an observation, but it was left for
Bacon to try and construct a prejudice-proof system
of arranging and classifying the results. These
<i>instances</i>, as they were called, were, on the one hand,
to be manufactured by means of <i>experiment</i>, and on
the other to be arranged and weeded out according
to their significance. The word <i>crucial</i> comes to us
from Bacon’s Latin phrase ‘<span lang="la">instantia crucis</span>’—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
<i>crucial instance</i>—which, like a sign-post, decided
between two rival hypotheses by proving one and disproving
the other; and it may be said that he endeavoured,
but failed, to alter the meaning of <i>axiom</i>
itself from “a self-evident proposition” to “a proposition
established by the method of experimental
induction”.</p>

<p>Once more men turned the light of their curiosity
upon the stubborn phenomena of the outside world,
and as it was Aristotle’s works in which we first found
the Greek <i>anatomy</i>, ‘cutting up’, so it is Bacon who
first uses <i>dissection</i> (from the Latin for the same
thing) in its modern technical meaning. After an
interval of about 1,500 years, the weighing, measuring,
examining, and cutting up had now begun again,
and they have gone on ever since. How far Francis
Bacon was responsible for the form subsequently taken
by scientific thought will probably remain a matter
of dispute. His views on ecclesiastical authority,
on Scholastic philosophy, on Aristotle, on the Alchemists,
certainly suggest that he possessed what the
nineteenth century has called the “scientific attitude”
to an extent which distinguishes him startlingly
from any previous or contemporary writer; <i>acid</i>,
<i>hydraulic</i>, and <i>suction</i> are among the words first found
in his pages; but, above all, his consciousness of greater
changes afoot is manifested linguistically in such
things as his use of the words <i>progressive</i> and <i>retrograde</i>
in an historical sense unknown, as we shall see, to the
majority of thinkers until the middle of the eighteenth
century, or his equally innovating distinction between
<i>ancient</i> and <i>modern</i>. A marked increase over the second
quarter of the seventeenth century in the number
of words expressing the notion of doubt, such as
<i>dubious</i> (used of opinions), <i>dubiousness</i>, <i>dubitable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
ceptic</i>, <i>sceptical</i>, <i>sceptically</i>, <i>scepticism</i>, <i>scepticity</i>, <i>scepticize</i>,
compares with an increase of only one or two
during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. And at
about the same time the words <i>curious</i>, <i>curiosity</i>, and
<i>inquisitive</i> seem to have lost the air of pious disapproval
which they had previously carried with them when
used to express the love of inquiry. How much of
this is due to novel combinations, such as “a natural
<i>curiosity</i> and <i>inquisitive</i> appetite”, which we find in
Bacon’s <i>Advancement of Learning</i>? We cannot say.
There are symptoms of the coming metamorphosis
already, before his time, in the appearance in English
of the sixteenth century of such significant new terms
as <i>analyse</i>, <i>distinguish</i>, <i>investigate</i>, together with the
semantic change of <i>observe</i> from “to obey a rule”,
or “to inspect auguries” into its modern meaning,
and similar changes in the case of <i>experiment</i> and
<i>experimental</i>. It is impossible to prove these things.
As with Aristotle, so with Bacon, it is impossible to
say whether his own intellectual volume displaced the
great wave or whether he merely rose upon its early
crest.</p>

<p>There are other influences, too, that must be taken
into account. <i>Discovery</i> (it was a new word) was in
the very air of sixteenth-century England. From
the West came tidings of a new world; from the East
news yet more marvellous of an old one; and the rebirth
of Science was, in its infancy, but a single aspect of
that larger Renaissance which played such an important
part in moulding the subsequent life and outlook of
Europe. Italy had felt the shock first, and we have
a special group of words in our language to remind
us of the visual arts in which the new impulse drove her
to excel. <i>Cameo</i>, <i>cupola</i>, <i>fresco</i>, and <i>model</i> all reached
us in the sixteenth century from or through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
Italian, and the next saw the arrival of <i>attitude</i>, <i>bust</i>,
<i>chiaroscuro</i>, <i>dado</i>, <i>dome</i>, <i>filigree</i>, <i>intaglio</i>, <i>mezzotinto</i>,
and <i>pastel</i>. If these are of a somewhat technical
nature, words like <i>antic</i>, <i>canto</i>, <i>capriole</i>, <i>galligaskins</i>,
<i>sonnet</i>, and <i>stanza</i> build a bridge in the imagination
from Renaissance Italy to Tudor England, and
<i>ducat</i>, <i>incarnadine</i>, and <i>madonna</i> are three Italian
words with pleasant Shakespearian associations. They
remind us, too, that by the time the Renaissance
reached England it was already in full swing. No
wonder the literary world was swept off its feet.
First-hand acquaintance with the works of Classical
writers gradually substituted an affectionate, an
almost passionate, familiarity for that religious awe
with which the Middle Ages had honoured their
garbled translations. One of the first results—an
immediate and violent intellectual revolt against the
Schoolmen and all things connected with them—is
faithfully preserved to us in the unenviable immortality
achieved about this time by the luckless Duns Scotus,
whose patronymic has given us <i>dunce</i>. The history
of the word <i>conceit</i>, which in Chaucer merely meant
‘anything conceived’, tells its tale of the wild, undiscriminating
rush after elegance of thought and
diction. By Shakespeare’s time the tasteless habit
of piling fanciful conceit upon conceit had already
become a thing to parody, the merest affectation of
wit, and so the word lives to-day chiefly as a synonym
for personal vanity, the language having been obliged
by its degradation to re-borrow the Latin original
‘conceptus’ in the more exact form of <i>concept</i>.</p>

<p>It can readily be imagined that the restless activity
which these little symptoms betoken had a remarkable
effect in altering, developing, and indeed modernizing,
the English vocabulary. The genius of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
language sprouted and burgeoned in the genial warmth
of Elizabethan and Jacobean fancy, and—most effective
of all—it passed through the fire of Shakespeare’s
imagination. There is an unobtrusiveness about
Shakespeare’s enormous influence on his native tongue
which sometimes recalls the records of his private life.
This is no doubt partly due to the very popularity
of his plays, which has preserved the direct influence
in every age. Where the word which he employs
is a new one, it has usually become so common in the
course of years that we find it hard to conceive of the
time when it was not. Where it is a meaning or a
shade of meaning which he has added, as likely as not
that very shade was the one most familiar to our
own childhood before we had ever read a line of his
poetry. Phrases and whole lines from the plays and
sonnets are as much a part of the English vocabulary
as individual words. Such are <i>pitched battle</i>, <i>play on
words</i>, <i>give him his due</i>, <i>well on your way</i>, <i>too much of
a good thing</i>, <i>to the manner born</i>, <i>the glass of fashion</i>,
<i>snapper-up of unconsidered trifles</i>, <i>more honoured in
the breach than the observance</i>,... The influence of
such a mind on the language in which it expresses
itself can only be compared to the effect of high
temperatures on solid matter. As imagination bodies
forth the forms of things unknown, each molecule of
suggestiveness contained in each word gains a mysterious
freedom from its neighbours; the old images
move to and fro distinctly in the listener’s fancy,
and when the sound has died away, not merely the
shape, but what seemed to be the very substance of
the word has been readjusted.</p>

<p>Examples are found readily enough with the help of
a volume of Shakespeare and the <cite>Oxford Dictionary</cite>.
As to new words themselves, it has been said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
there are more in Shakespeare’s plays than in all the
rest of the English poets put together. <i>Advantageous</i>,
<i>amazement</i>, <i>critic</i> and <i>critical</i>, <i>dishearten</i>, <i>dwindle</i>,
<i>generous</i>, <i>invulnerable</i>, <i>majestic</i>, <i>obscene</i>, <i>pedant</i>, <i>pious</i>,
<i>radiance</i>, <i>reliance</i>, and <i>sanctimonious</i> are a few
examples, but it is still more interesting to trace the
subtler part of his influence. As an instance of what
we may call his literary alertness let us take the word
<i>propagate</i>. It is not found in English before 1570,
and is thus a new word in Shakespeare’s time. Yet
he handles it four times, now literally, now figuratively,
with as much ease and grace as if it had been one of
the oldest words in the language. Listen to Romeo:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With more of thine.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, the figurative—that is to say, the only modern
use of <i>influence</i>—is first quoted from his works, and we
can watch him gradually taking the meaning of the
word sphere through its historical developments of
planetary ‘<i>sphere</i>’, high social rank, any sort of
category. A certain curious intransitive use of the
verb <i>take</i>, as when a doctor says “the vaccination
<i>took</i> very well,” can also be traced back to Shakespeare,
and a few more of the innumerable new uses of words
which appear to have begun from him are <i>sequence</i>
and <i>creed</i>, with purely secular meanings; <i>real</i>, in its
ordinary modern sense of ‘actual’; <i>magic</i>, <i>magical</i>,
and <i>charm</i><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, used figuratively; <i>apology</i> as the personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and verbal expression of compunction; <i>positive</i> in its
psychological sense; <i>function</i>, used biologically; <i>fashion</i>
and <i>fashionable</i> with their modern meanings; and
<i>action</i>, meaning a battle. The fact that the first
examples of these new uses quoted in the <i>Oxford
Dictionary</i> are taken from Shakespeare cannot, of
course, be taken as absolute proof that he introduced
them. But there are so many of them, and the
<i>Dictionary</i> is so thorough, that there can be no doubt
of his being the first in most cases and among the first
in every case.</p>

<p>Shakespeare’s influence on the personal relations
between the sexes, as they have developed in subsequent
periods of English history, is a matter for the literary
and social historian; but it is interesting to reflect
how the meanings of that group of Norman French
words mentioned in the last chapter, and of others
which were slowly drawn into their circle, must have
expanded under the warm breath of his vivacious and
human heroines. The ideal atmosphere of gracious
tenderness which was the contribution to humanity
of the Middle Ages was to some extent realized by
the Elizabethans. The women towards whom it was
directed became less and less mere ecclesiastical
symbols, existing only in the imagination of the lover,
and more and more creatures of real flesh and blood.
Once again it is a case of a later age striving to live
out what an earlier age—or its few best minds—have
dreamed. Thus, the Blessed Virgin is partly
supplanted in men’s hearts by the virgin Queen;
the charming figure of Sidney—personified gentleness
and chivalry—actually passes across the stage of
history; the peculiarly English word <i>gentleman</i> appears.
And we can hardly help holding Shakespeare partly
responsible for what is going forward when we find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
him writing “the devout religion of mine eye” and
making Richard III implore Anne to “let the soul
forth that adoreth thee”—where the words <i>religion</i>
and <i>adore</i> are both applied to humanity for the first
time, as far as we know, in English literature.</p>

<p>Moreover, the new access to the Classics added to
all this the direct influence of the Platonic philosophy
which now played, through Spenser and his circle,
upon the thought and feeling of the Elizabethan age.
A careful reading of Spenser’s four hymns to <cite>Love</cite>,
<cite>Beauty</cite>, <cite>Heavenly Love</cite>, and <cite>Heavenly Beauty</cite> will
throw much light on the subsequent semantic history
of the title words and of many others. We find in
them the Platonic antithesis between the Eternal
and its for-ever-changing outward garment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For that same goodly hew of white and red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With which the cheekes are sprinckled, shall decay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And those sweete rosy leaves so fairely spread</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the conception of contemplation rising, through

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For love is Lord of truth and loialtie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lifting himselfe out of the lowly dust,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Unto their minde....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">until finally, in the <cite>Hymne of Heavenly Beauty</cite>, Spenser
reveals the source of his faith:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Faire is the heaven, where happy soules have place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In full enjoyment of felicitie....</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">More faire is that where those <i>Idees</i> on hie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enraunged be, which <i>Plato</i> so admyred,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pure <i>Intelligences</i> from God inspyred.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When we recall the great influence which Spenser’s
poetry has exerted on English poets who have lived
and written since his day, we can clearly see how the
two kinds of Platonism—a direct Platonism, and a
Platonism long ago transmuted and worked right down
into the emotions of common people by the passionate
Christianity of the Dark and Middle Ages—combined
to beget the infinite suggestiveness which is now
contained in such words as <i>love</i> and <i>beauty</i>. Let us
remember, then, that every time we abuse these terms,
or use them too lightly, we are draining them of their
power; every time a society journalist or a film
producer exploits this vast suggestiveness to tickle a
vanity or dignify a lust, he is squandering a great
pile of spiritual capital which has been laid up by
centuries of weary effort.</p>

<p>The fact that a great deal of what had formerly
been religious emotion was being secularized in this
way does not, however, mean that the Church had
ceased to play an all-important part in the life of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
people. The Reformation seems, with its insistence
on the <i>inwardness</i> of all true grace, to have been but
another manifestation of that steady shifting inwards
of the centre of gravity of human consciousness which
we have already observed in the scientific outlook.
That shift is, in a larger sense, the story told by the
whole history of the Aryan languages. Thus <i>religion</i>
itself, which had formerly been used only of external
observances or of monastic orders, took on at about
this time its modern, subjective meaning. Now it
was that <i>piety</i>, differentiating itself from <i>pity</i>, began
to acquire its present sense. <i>Godly</i>, <i>godliness</i>, and
<i>godless</i> are first found in Tindale’s writings, and
<i>evangelical</i> and <i>sincere</i> are words which have been noted
by a modern writer as being new at this time and
very popular among the Protestants. The great word
<i>Protestant</i> itself was applied formerly to the German
princes who had dissented from the decision of the
Diet of Spires in 1529, and together with <i>Reformation</i>
it now acquired its new and special meaning, while
the old words, <i>dissent</i> and <i>disagree</i>, were transferred
at about the same time from material objects to matters
of opinion.</p>

<p>Another little group of words which appeared in
the language at about this time is interesting in its
suggestion that human emotions, like the forces of
Nature, are usually accompanied by their equal and
opposite reactions. The well-known phrases, <i>odium
theologicum</i> and <i>odium philosophicum</i>, survive to remind
us of a new kind of bitterness and hatred which had
slowly been arising in men’s hearts, and which were
also, it would seem, the gifts of Christianity and the
Dark Ages. Very soon after the Reformation we find
alongside the syllables of tenderness and devotion a
very pretty little vocabulary of abuse. <i>Bigoted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
action</i>, <i>factious</i>, <i>malignant</i>, <i>monkish</i>, <i>papistical</i>,
<i>pernicious</i>, <i>popery</i> are among the products of the
struggle between Catholic and Protestant; and the
terms <i>Roman</i>, <i>Romanist</i>, and <i>Romish</i> soon acquired
such a vituperative sense that it became necessary to
evolve <i>Roman Catholic</i> in order to describe the adherents
of that faith without giving offence to them. The
later internecine struggles among the Protestants
themselves gave us <i>Puritan</i>, <i>precise</i>, <i>libertine</i>—reminiscent
of a time when “liberty” of thought was
assumed as a matter of course to include licence of
behaviour—<i>credulous</i>, <i>superstitious</i>, <i>selfish</i>, <i>selfishness</i>,
and the awful Calvinistic word <i>reprobate</i>. It was
towards the end of the Puritan ascendancy
that <i>atone</i> and <i>atonement</i> (<i>at-one-ment</i>) acquired
their present strong suggestion of legal expiation,
and it may not be without significance that the
odious epithet <i>vindictive</i> was then for the first time
applied approvingly to the activities of the Almighty
Himself.</p>

<p>As the language grows older, when all the principal
tributaries have met at last in the main stream, it begins,
unfortunately, to tell a less and less coherent tale of
the people who speak it. The few large groups of
new words and meanings which we have hitherto
been tracing give way to a much greater number
of small groups—or even of single words—for the
vocabulary is now so capacious that important new
movements of thought are likely to find the old terms
adaptable to their use with very slight semantic
alterations, or perhaps with the formal addition of
an <i>-arian</i>, an <i>-ism</i>, or an <i>-ology</i>. These become accordingly
harder to trace, and a book of these dimensions
is obliged to select a word here and a word there in
almost arbitrary fashion. It must be remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
then, in this and the succeeding chapters that only
a few of the tendencies and changes at work have been
picked out for inspection, though it is probable that
a study of words, which should be at the same time
subtle and comprehensive enough, would throw some
light on them all.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">When Charles II returned from France to an
England which had long been growing more and
more sullen under the reproving glances of a middle-aged
Puritanism, the suppressed thoughts and feelings
of fashionable English society evidently lost no time
in rising to the surface. The appearance in the seventeenth
century of new expressions such as to <i>banter</i>,
to <i>burlesque</i>, to <i>ridicule</i>, to <i>prim</i>, <i>travesty</i>, <i>badinage</i>,
and, above all, <i>prig</i>, helps to fill in for the imagination
the deep gulf between the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> and the
<i>Country Wife</i>. Even to those totally unacquainted
with the literature of the period this little archipelago
of words might betray with unmistakable solidity the
moral geography of the submerged region. For it
marks a cycle of events which has been repeated over
and over again in the history of humanity, in its families,
its societies, its nations. Certain moral qualities gain
respect for themselves; the respect brings with it
material benefits; weaker brethren affect the moral
qualities in order to acquire the material benefits;
hypocrisy is detected; all morality is treated as hypocrisy.
The trite little cycle spins like a whirligig round
and round the social history of the world, but this
is a good place to lay a finger on it, for it is a process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
in which the question of the meanings of words takes
a particularly active part. It is, in fact, one of the few
occasions upon which ordinary men, neither scientists
nor poets, will deliberately attempt to alter the meanings
of the words they must use. “Morality”, said
the late Sir Walter Raleigh, “colours all language
and lends to it the most delicate of its powers of
distinction”; and so, when any significant change
takes place in the moral standards of a community,
it is immediately reflected in a general shifting of
the meanings of common words.</p>

<p>One of the earliest recorded examples of such a
shift is analysed with sharp penetration by Thucydides
in his account of the demoralization of the Greek
States during the Peloponnesian War:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Proper shame [he says] is now termed sheer stupidity:
shamelessness, on the other hand, is called manliness:
voluptuousness passes for good tone: haughtiness for good
education: lawlessness for freedom: honourable dealing
is dubbed hypocrisy, and dishonesty, good fortune.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Similar, but less conspicuous and rapid, alterations
of mood must have been at work when <i>silly</i> lost its
old meaning of ‘blessed’; when <i>demure</i> changed from
‘grave’ or ‘sober’ to ‘affectedly modest’; and
when the kindly <i>officious</i> acquired its modern sense
of bustling interference. Trench regards it as a
tribute to the Roman character that theirs is the
only civilized language in which the word for ‘simple’
never acquired a contemptuous signification alongside
of its ordinary one. And at the opposite pole from
Thucydides we have another Aryan historian, Mr.
G. K. Chesterton, good-humouredly suggesting what
might be called a semantic method of slipping off
a Semitic incubus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As for sin, let us call it folly and have done with it, for
until we call it folly we never shall have done with it. The
conception of sin flatters us grossly. There is something
grandiose in it that cannot but appeal to the child in every
man. That we infinitesimal creatures, scrambling like ants
over the face of this minor planet in pursuit of our personal
aims—that we have it in our power to affront the majesty
of the universe is a most preposterous, delightful fancy....</p>
</div>

<p>It may be remarked in passing that there is no surer
or more illuminating way of reading a man’s character,
and perhaps a little of his past history, than by observing
the contexts in which he prefers to use certain
words. Each of us would no doubt choose his own
list of test words—and the lists themselves, if we
were foolish enough to reveal them, would probably
present a fairly accurate diagram of our own leading
propensities. Fortunately the subject is too long to
elaborate.</p>

<p><i>Ogle</i> is another new word which appeared soon after
the Restoration; and at the same time <i>intrigue</i>, which
had come into the language earlier in the century in
the general sense of ‘intricacy’, was seized upon
to express an illicit love-affair. The steady growth
of “polite” society during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries is also—curiously enough—indicated
by the gradual appearance of <i>bearish</i>, <i>countrified</i>,
<i>fatuous</i>, <i>flippant</i>, <i>gawky</i>, <i>mawkish</i>, <i>prude</i>, and
other such terms. <i>Hoyden</i> was first used of a girl by
Wycherley in 1676.</p>

<p>But outside the limelit circle this period was one
of rapid intellectual development. That the novel
interest in the external world, typified in the sixteenth
century by such new words as <i>analyse</i>, <i>distinguish</i>,
<i>investigate</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, expanded continuously during the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
hundred years is suggested by the addition to
our vocabulary of <i>inspect</i>, <i>remark</i>, and <i>scrutinize</i>,
together with the modern meanings of <i>perception</i> and
<i>scrutiny</i>, which had meant up till then respectively
‘the collection of rents’ and ‘the taking of a vote.’
We also find a group of new words to describe the
inherent conditions and qualities of external objects,
such as <i>acid</i>, <i>astringency</i>, <i>cohesion</i>, <i>elasticity</i>, <i>equilibrium</i>,
<i>fluid</i> (as a noun), <i>intensity</i>, <i>polarity</i>, <i>pressure</i>, <i>spontaneous</i>,
<i>static</i>, <i>temperature</i>, <i>tendency</i>, <i>tension</i>, <i>volatile</i>,
besides the physical and impersonal meanings of <i>energy</i>
and <i>force</i>. The old verb to <i>discover</i>, which originally
signified simply to ‘uncover’ or ‘reveal,’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> was used
attributively in the sixteenth century of travellers
‘discovering’ foreign lands and customs. Shortly
after the Restoration the new metaphor, so it would
seem, was itself applied metaphorically to the results
of a chemical experiment, and in this way the ordinary
modern meaning arose. The creation of the new
word <i>gas</i> by the Dutch chemist van Helmont marks
a definite epoch in the evolution of the scientific outlook.
He used it, however, to describe an occult
principle—a sort of ultra-rarefied water—which he
supposed to be contained in all matter. It was not
until the last quarter of the eighteenth century that
the word acquired its modern meaning of ‘matter
in the condition of an aeriform fluid’, at which time
the word <i>gaseous</i> also appeared. <i>Ether</i> (Greek ‘aithēr’,
‘the <i>upper</i> air’ above the clouds), which had been
practically a synonym for the Aristotelian <i>quintessence</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>,
was now adopted to express the mechanical
substitute for that spiritual medium required by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
modern science in order to explain the phenomenon
of action at a distance. These are among the first
attempts which were made to describe the outer world
objectively—from its own point of view instead of
from the point of view of divinity or of human souls;
it is interesting, therefore, to reflect that the success
achieved is really only a relative one, as all the words
mentioned, with the possible exception of <i>gas</i>,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> are in
the first place metaphors drawn from human activities
such as those of ‘cutting’, ‘stretching’, and ‘pulling’.</p>

<p>In about the year 1660 the spirit of curious inquiry
which was abroad prompted the foundation of the
Royal Society, for the purpose, as its title announced,
of “Improving Natural Knowledge,” and it is notable
that the word <i>improve</i> should have been employed.
Originating, as we saw, in Lawyer’s French, it had
been used up to about 1620 to denote merely “the
enclosure and cultivation of waste land”. So that
when we find its old meaning butchered to make a
striking metaphor, it is reasonable to assume that
some new idea or feeling had come to the front, to
which men were struggling to give the outward expression
that is life, that their outlook had changed
somewhat, and that they were groping for a means
of readjusting their cosmos accordingly.</p>

<p>We have attempted so far to trace the evolution of
Western outlook from the earliest days of Greece
down to the Revival of Learning in England. It
must not be forgotten that this process is hitherto an
unconscious one. Up to the seventeenth century the
outlook of the European mind upon the world, fluid as
it has always been, has yet always felt itself to be at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
rest, just as men have hitherto believed that the earth
on which they trod was a solid and motionless body.
The first appearance of a distinction between <i>ancient</i>
and <i>modern</i>, and of the word <i>progressive</i>, in Bacon’s
<i>Essays</i> has already been noted, and we find that
<i>progress</i> itself had only begun to emerge a few years
before from its relatively parochial meaning of ‘royal
journey’ or, as we still say, ‘progress’. To the
seventeenth century, as Mr. Pearsall Smith has pointed
out, we owe the words <i>antiquated</i>, <i>century</i>, <i>decade</i>,
<i>epoch</i>, <i>Gothic</i>, <i>out-of-date</i>, <i>primeval</i>, and we may add to
these <i>contemporary</i>, <i>contemporaneous</i>, <i>synchronise</i>, <i>synchronous</i>,
and a queer jungle-growth of words with
similar meanings which sprang up about the middle
of the seventeenth century and has since vanished:
<i>contemporal</i>, <i>co-temporary</i>, <i>contemporize</i>, <i>isochronal</i>,
<i>synchronal</i>, <i>synchronical</i>, <i>synchronism</i>, <i>synchronistic</i>.
A curious feature about these latter words is the number
of them which first appeared in theological writings,
the mystic philosopher, Henry More, being alone
responsible for three. They seem to have arisen
chiefly from an interest in comparing the dates of
different events recorded in Scripture, and they may
thus be placed beside the epithet <i>primitive</i>, applied
by the Reformers to the early Church, which Mr.
Pearsall Smith has pointed to as “probably the first
word in which our modern historical sense finds
expression”.</p>

<p>When we try combing the dictionaries—Greek, Latin,
English, and others—for words expressing a sense of
the “march of history”, or indeed of a past or future
differing at all essentially from the present, we are
forced to the conclusion that this kind of outlook on
time is a surprisingly recent growth. We saw how
the Greek ‘historia’ could mean practically any kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of knowledge; in the same way, when ‘periodos’
(literally ‘way round’) was used of time, it meant a
cycle, one of a recurring series; it was not till the
eighteenth century that a <i>period</i> of history acquired
its modern sense of an indefinite portion cut from a
continuous process. Labels like <i>Middle Ages</i>, <i>Renaissance</i>,
... are none of them earlier than the eighteenth
century, which also saw the new expressions <i>develop</i>
and <i>development</i>, and the fact that the significant words
<i>anachronism</i>,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> <i>evolution</i>,<a id="FNanchor_48a" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and <i>prehistoric</i>, with the new
perspectives they denote, only appeared during the
nineteenth century may make us doubtful whether
the mists of time have even yet fallen wholly from
our eyes.</p>

<p>In order to enter sympathetically into the outlook
of an educated medieval gentleman, we have to perform
the difficult feat of undressing, as it were, our own
outlook by divesting it of all those seemingly innate
ideas of progress and evolution, of a movement of some
sort going on everywhere around us, which make
our cosmos what it is. This is more difficult even
than it sounds, because so many of these thoughts
and feelings have become sub-conscious. We have
imbibed them with our vocabulary and cannot without
much labour and research disentangle the part that
is due to them from the rest of our consciousness.
Let us try, for a moment, to realize with our imaginations
as well as with our intellects the world in which
our fathers dwelt—a world created abruptly at a
fixed moment in time, and awaiting a destruction
equally abrupt, its inhabitants for ever to be the same,
and for ever struggling, not to <i>progress</i> or to <i>evolve</i>
into something different, but merely to become once
more exactly like the first man and woman. Where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
we speak of <i>progress</i> and <i>evolution</i>, the Middle Ages
could speak only of <i>regeneration</i> and <i>amendment</i>.
Their evolution was like Alice’s race with the Red
Queen. It took all their energies to keep still; and
even in this they had very little hope of succeeding,
for they believed that the world was getting steadily
worse.</p>

<p>But perhaps their total lack of historical imagination
is brought home to us most forcibly by the prevalent
belief that—apart from the Chosen People—all the
inhabitants of the pre-Christian world were doomed
to eternal exclusion from paradise. When we recollect
that for some time the doctors of medieval universities
were obliged to swear upon oath that they would
teach nothing contrary to the doctrines of a Greek
philosopher who must already have been in this situation
for three hundred years at the birth of the
Redeemer, and when we further reflect that it was the
acute brains of these very doctors which were engaged
in building up our present thinking apparatus, we may
well feel inclined to give up as hopeless the task of
sympathetically recreating the medieval cosmos in
our imaginations—unless we realize, as indeed the
history of meanings clearly shows, that it is not merely
ideas and theories and feelings which have changed,
but the very method of forming ideas and of combining
them, the very channels, apparently eternal, by which
one thought or feeling is connected with another.
Possibly the Middle Ages would have been equally bewildered
at the facility with which twentieth-century
minds are brought to believe that, intellectually,
humanity languished for countless generations in the
most childish errors on all sorts of crucial subjects,
until it was redeemed by some simple scientific dictum
of the last century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>There is another difference between the past and
the present which it is hard for us to realize; and
perhaps this is the hardest of all. For with the
seventeenth century we reach the point at which we
must at last try to pick up and inspect that discarded
garment of the human soul, intimate and close-fitting
as it was, into which this book has been trying from
the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">fifth chapter</a> onwards to induce the reader to re-insert
his modern limbs. The consciousness of ‘myself’
and the distinction between ‘my-self’ and all other
selves, the antithesis between ‘myself’, the observer,
and the external world, the observed, is such an obvious
and early fact of experience to every one of us, such a
fundamental starting-point of our life as conscious
beings, that it really requires a sort of training of the
imagination to be able to conceive of any different
kind of consciousness. Yet we can see from the history
of our words that this form of experience, so far from
being eternal, is quite a recent achievement of the
human spirit. It was absent from the old mythological
outlook; absent, in its fullness, from Plato and the Greek
philosophers; and, though it was beginning to light up
in the Middle Ages, as we see in the development of
Scholastic words like <i>individual</i> and <i>person</i>, yet the
medieval soul was still felt to be joined by all sorts
of occult ties both to the physical body and to the
world. Self-consciousness, as we know it, seems to
have first dawned faintly on Europe at about the time
of the Reformation, and it was not till the seventeenth
century that the new light really began to spread and
brighten. One of the surest signs that an idea or feeling
is coming to the surface of consciousness—surer than
the appearance of one or two new words—is the tendency
of an old one to form compounds and derivatives.
After the Reformation we notice growing up in our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
language a whole crop of words hyphened with <i>self</i>;
such are <i>self-conceit</i>, <i>self-liking</i>, <i>self-love</i>, and others
at the end of the sixteenth century, and <i>self-confidence</i>,
<i>self-command</i>, <i>self-contempt</i>, <i>self-esteem</i>, <i>self-knowledge</i>,
<i>self-pity</i>, ... in the next.</p>

<p>From a full list of such words as the above the
historical student of words and their meanings could
almost predict, apart from any other source of knowledge,
the appearance at about this time of some philosopher
who should do intellectually to the cosmos
what Copernicus and Kepler had already done
astronomically—that is, turn it inside out. And in
Descartes, with his doctrine of “<span lang="la">Cogito, ergo sum</span>”,
we do, in fact, find just such a philosopher. His
influence was immense. Practically all philosophy
since his day has worked outwards from the thinking
self rather than inwards from the cosmos to the soul.
In England, not long afterwards, we find the brand-new
expressions, ‘the <i>ego</i>’ and <i>egoism</i>, coming into
the language from French philosophy, while the
English thinker, Locke, adopts the new (1632) word
<i>consciousness</i>, defining it as ‘perception of what passes
in a man’s own mind’, and at the same time impresses
on the still newer <i>self-consciousness</i><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> its distinctive
modern meaning.</p>

<p>Though these two developments—the birth of an
historical sense and the birth of our modern self-consciousness—may
seem at first sight to have little
connection with one another, yet it is not difficult,
on further consideration, to perceive that they are
both connected with that other and larger process
which has already been pointed to as the story told
by the history of the Aryan languages as a whole.
If we wish to find a name for it, we should have to coin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
some such ugly word as “internalization”. It is the
shifting of the centre of gravity of consciousness from
the cosmos around him into the personal human being
himself. The results are twofold: on the one hand
the peculiar freedom of mankind, the <em>spontaneous</em><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
impulses which control human behaviour and destiny,
are felt to arise more and more from <em>within</em> the
individual, as we saw in the semantic change of such
words as <i>conscience</i>, <i>disposition</i>, <i>spirit</i>, <i>temper</i>, ...
in the application to inner processes of words like
<i>dissent</i>, <i>gentle</i>, <i>perceive</i>, <i>religion</i>, and in the Protestant
Reformation; on the other the spiritual life and activity
felt to be immanent in the world outside—in star and
planet, in herb and animal, in the juices and “humours”
of the body, and in the outward ritual of the Church—these
grow feebler. The conception of “laws” governing
this world arises and grows steadily more impersonal;
words like <i>consistency</i>, <i>pressure</i>, <i>tension</i>,
... are found to describe matter “objectively” and
disinterestedly, and at the same time the earth ceases
to be the centre round which the cosmos revolves.
All this time the European ‘ego’ appears to be engaged,
unawares, in disentangling itself from its environment—becoming
less and less of the actor, more and more of
both the author and the spectator. In the eighteenth
century the word <i>outlook</i> is used for the first time in the
sense in which it has been used here; in the nineteenth
<i>environment</i> is introduced by Carlyle. And so it goes
on; and as, on the one hand, it is only when that
detachment has progressed to a certain point that
man becomes able to observe the changes which
constitute history, so it is only as he begins to observe
them that he becomes fully conscious of himself—the
observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>Thus, the general process which we have called
“internalization” can be traced working itself out
into all kinds of details; not only in that intimate,
metaphysical change of outlook which it is so hard
for us to realize now that the change has taken place—in
the appearance of words betokening a sharper self-consciousness—but
also in the moral and personal
sphere. We could, for instance, take such a common
word as <i>duty</i> and mark its expansion of meaning at
about the time of Shakespeare. By its derivation it
carries the sense of ‘owing’ and it meant in Chaucer’s
time an act of obedience which was owed to some
other person—usually to a feudal superior.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It is
not till the close of the sixteenth century that it begins
to take on its modern sense of a more or less <em>abstract</em>
moral obligation—an obligation owed, if to any being,
to oneself or to a sort of ideal of manhood—such an
ideal, for instance, as is expressed in the word <i>gentleman</i>.
Later on, as with <i>conscience</i>, there is a tendency to
personify it. At the beginning of the seventeenth
century we first find the word <i>Nature</i> employed in
contexts where medieval writers would certainly have
used the single word <i>God</i>. <i>Spontaneous</i> has already
been mentioned, and it is interesting to note a certain
tendency, which seems to have been inherent, before
Shakespeare’s time, in the adjective <i>voluntary</i>, to
connote disapproval when it was applied to human
actions or feelings. Later in the century the word
<i>character</i><a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> was first used in its modern personal sense
by the historian Clarendon.</p>

<p>Students of the period know well the sudden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
extraordinary craze for “character-drawing” which
swept over France and England at this time. In
France literary “portraits” of oneself and one’s friends
were produced in hundreds, the first as a hobby,
the second actually as a round game; and Clarendon,
whose <i>History of the Great Rebellion</i> is a string of such
character-studies, was only doing systematically what
men like Hall, Overbury, Earle, and others had already
done in a more disjointed and dilettante way. To
the medieval observer a <i>person</i> or a <i>soul</i> had been
interesting chiefly in its relation to Society, to the
Church, to the Cosmos. “All the personality of man,”
said Wyclif, “standeth in the spirit of him.” But
these new writers and their readers were interested in
<i>characters</i> and <i>characteristics</i> for their own sakes. We
begin to hear of people’s <i>autographs</i>, of their <i>foibles</i>
and their <i>fortes</i>; <i>eccentric</i> is taken from astronomy
and mathematics; the Greek word <i>idiosyncrasy</i>—signifying
an ‘individual mixture’ (of ‘humours’)—is
borrowed from Galen; but with the new point of
view the astrological and physical meanings of this
and other words, like <i>disposition</i>, <i>humour</i>, <i>spirits</i>,
<i>temperament</i>, ...<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> gradually fade away, and their
modern meanings arise instead. One relic of these
ancient physics, however—the <i>vapours</i> which were
supposed to rise into the head from the region of
the stomach—lingered well on into the eighteenth
century; and from the way in which Boswell and
Johnson write of their fits of <i>melancholy</i>, it seems that
they had just reached a point at which they could not
be sure, from their feelings at any rate, whether their
common malady was physical in its origin or purely
mental.</p>

<p>The same difference is observable in the names for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
feelings and passions. The nomenclature of the Middle
Ages generally views them from without, hinting
always at their results or their moral significance—<i>envy</i>,
<i>greedy</i>, <i>happy</i> (i.e. ‘lucky’), <i>malice</i>, <i>mercy</i>,
<i>mildheartness</i>, <i>peace</i>, <i>pity</i><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, <i>remorse</i>, <i>repentance</i>, <i>rue</i>,
<i>sin</i>,... Even the old word <i>sad</i> had not long
lost its original sense of ‘sated’, ‘heavy’ (which it
still retains in <i>sad bread</i>), and <i>fear</i> continued for a long
time to mean, not the emotion, but a ‘sudden and
unexpected event’. Hardly before the beginning of
the seventeenth century do we find expressed that
sympathetic or “introspective” attitude to the feelings
which is conveyed by such labels as <i>aversion</i>, <i>dissatisfaction</i>,
<i>discomposure</i>, ... while <i>depression</i> and <i>emotion</i>—further
lenient names for human weaknesses—were
used till then of material objects.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century we notice, as we should
expect, a considerable increase in the number of these
words which attempt to portray character or feeling
from within; such are <i>apathy</i>, <i>chagrin</i>, <i>diffidence</i>,
<i>ennui</i>, <i>homesickness</i>, together with the expression
‘the <i>feelings</i>‘, while <i>agitation</i>, <i>constraint</i>, <i>disappointment</i>,
<i>embarrassment</i>, <i>excitement</i> are transferred from
the outer to the inner world. <i>Outlook</i>, which meant
‘a place from which a good view is obtained’,
was first employed figuratively by Dr. Young in
1742.</p>

<p>This brings us to another class of words—appropriate
enough to the century which produced Berkeley’s
<i>Principles of Human Knowledge</i>—describing external
things not objectively, from their own point of view,
but purely by the <i>effects</i> which they produce on human
beings, such, for instance, as <i>affecting</i>, <i>amusing</i>, <i>boring</i>,
<i>charming</i>, <i>diverting</i>, <i>entertaining</i>, <i>enthralling</i>, <i>entrancing</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
<i>exciting</i>, <i>fascinating</i>, <i>interesting</i>, and <i>pathetic</i> in its
modern sense, none of which are found before the
seventeenth and only a few before the eighteenth
century. These adjectives can be distinguished sharply—indeed
they are in a sense the very opposite of
those older words, which can also be said, though
less accurately, to describe external objects “from the
human point of view”. Thus, when a Roman spoke
of events as <i>auspicious</i> or <i>sinister</i>, or when some
natural object was said in the Middle Ages to be
<i>baleful</i>, or <i>benign</i>, or <i>malign</i>, a herb to possess such and
such a <i>virtue</i>, an eye to be <i>evil</i>, or the bones of a saint
to be <i>holy</i>, or even, probably, when Gower wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The day was <i>merry</i> and <i>fair</i> enough,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">it is true that these things were described from the
human point of view, but the activity was felt to
emanate from the object itself. When we speak
of an object or an event as <i>amusing</i>, on the contrary,
we know that the process indicated by the word
<i>amuse</i> takes place within ourselves; and this is
none the less obvious because some of the adjectives
recorded above, such as <i>charming</i>, <i>enchanting</i>, and
<i>fascinating</i>, are the present participles of verbs which
had implied genuine, occult activity.</p>

<p>The change is an important one; it is a reverberation
into wider and wider circles of the scholastic
progress from Realism to Nominalism, and inside the
walls of the Church we can perceive the same movement
going on at the Reformation in the Protestant
and Dissenting tendency to abandon belief in the
Real Presence. Perhaps the somersault was turned
most neatly by the old Aristotelean word <i>subjective</i>,
which developed in the seventeenth century from its
former meaning of ‘existing in itself’ to the modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
one of ‘existing in human consciousness’. <i>Objective</i>
made a similar move in the opposite direction. When
using such words as “progress” and “develop” in
this connection, however, we must remember that the
semantic histories of words merely inform us of changes
which have actually occurred in a large number of
minds or “outlooks”. They tell us of what is earlier
and what is later, but not of truth and error. In this
direction all that a knowledge of them can do is to equip
us a little better for forming opinions of our own.</p>

<p>At the same time we find a few words to denote the
kind of people who are easily “affected” in this way.
<i>Susceptible</i> is first found in Clarendon, and in the
eighteenth century the words <i>sensible</i> and <i>sensibility</i>
acquire their special sense of ‘easily affected’ or
‘having the emotions easily aroused’; and as this
kind of experience grows more familiar, clearer heads
become conscious of it, and the new words <i>sentiment</i>
and <i>sentimental</i> appear. <i>Sentimental</i>, which was first
used in the title of Sterne’s <i>Sentimental Journey</i>,
published in 1768, was found so convenient that the
French language borrowed and the German translated
it. No doubt these new notions of ‘sensibility’ and
‘sentimentality,’ of a variety of emotions lying dormant
in the bosom and waiting eagerly to be called forth,
combined with the recently developed interest in
character to produce the curious <i>personality</i>, which
acquired its modern meaning a few years later and has
gone on increasing in popularity ever since.</p>

<p>It is impossible in the short space that is left to us to
do justice to that extraordinary interlude in England’s
literary and social history—the eighteenth century.
The age of powder and platitudes, of <i>charmers</i> with
automatically heaving bosoms, ogling and simpering
at their corseted <i>swains</i>; the age of ugly shaven heads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
secretly perspiring under fashionable periwigs; the
age when country gentlemen erected artificial “ruins”
at the bottom of their gardens, and serious poets could
hardly mention the sea without adding a reference to
the <i>finny drove</i>—this age seems to us now to have
faded away as suddenly and inexplicably as it arose,
leaving only the faintest traces upon our language.
Those half-hidden vestiges, however—the just slightly
different shades of meaning with which sundry familiar
words were used a hundred and fifty years ago—sometimes
seem to fascinate us by the very paradox of
their proximity and elusiveness. We feel that, if
we could only bring them out in some way, we
might take from them the very form and pressure of
the age. And so, when we come across some particularly
popular word like <i>reason</i> in eighteenth-century
literature, we are sometimes tempted to lay down
the book, while imagination goes groping vainly
round the impenetrable fringe of that mysterious
no-man’s-land which lies between words and their
meanings.</p>

<p>If we would seek for the genesis of the curious clockwork
cosmos through which the minds and imaginations
of the period seem to have moved with a measure
of contentment, we should find it, perhaps, not so
very far back in the past. Emotionally, the age was
still dominated by a pronounced reaction against
religious fanaticism—an attitude we see reflected in
the changeable meaning of <i>enthusiasm</i>, which in Plato’s
Greek meant ‘possessed by a god’. Spenser uses it
in its Greek form in a good sense, but by the end of
the seventeenth century we find Henry More writing:
“If ever Christianity be exterminated, it will be by
enthusiasm”; and even as late as 1830 a certain zealous,
if dogmatic, Churchman thought it worth while to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
write and publish a <i>Natural History of Enthusiasm</i>,
in which that dreadful vice, especially in its theological
aspect, is castigated with much vigour. <i>Fanatic</i>,
which had also meant ‘possessed by a god or demon,’
underwent the same change of meaning and gave
birth to <i>fanaticism</i> about the middle of the seventeenth
century. <i>Extravagant</i>, which had formerly meant
‘non-codified’, got its new meaning and produced
<i>extravagance</i>. And the way in which the word <i>Gothic</i>
was used to describe anything barbarous and uncouth
reminds us of how the eighteenth century perceived
barbarity and uncouthness in many places where we
no longer see it—such as medieval architecture, much
of which was pulled down at this time and replaced
by buildings which were felt to be more “correct” and
classical.</p>

<p>Intellectually, on the other hand, men’s minds
seem to have been influenced above all things by
that conception of impersonal “laws” governing the
universe which, as we saw in the <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">last chapter</a>, was
scarcely apprehended before the previous century.
Poets and philosophers alike were delighted by the
perfect <i>order</i> in which they perceived the cosmos
to be arranged. They sought everywhere for examples
of this orderliness. Pope, for instance, praises Windsor
Forest on the ground that it is a place:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Not Chaos-like together crush’d and bruis’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, as the world, harmoniously confus’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where order in variety we see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And where, tho’ all things differ, all agree.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This appreciation of Nature’s neatness—from which
we do not ourselves so easily derive poetic inspiration—is
now so familiar that it is difficult for us to realize
its freshness at that time. Yet this is unquestionably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
demonstrated by the dates at which such crucial words
as <i>arrange</i>, <i>category</i>, <i>classify</i>, <i>method</i>, <i>organize</i>, <i>organization</i>,
<i>regular</i>, <i>regulate</i>, <i>regularity</i>, <i>system</i>, <i>systematic</i>, ...
or their modern meanings, appeared in the language.
Only two of these are earlier than the seventeenth,
and most of them are not found till the eighteenth
century. Thus, <i>arrange</i> was a military term like
<i>array</i> until that time, and <i>regular</i> was only used of
monastic “orders” until the close of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>It is this universal conformity to laws, then, this
perfect order reigning everywhere undisturbed, which
the eighteenth century seems to have had in mind
when it used, and sometimes personified, the word
<i>Reason</i>. Reason explained everything.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let godlike Reason from her sovereign throne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speak the commanding word—I will—and it is done,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">wrote James Thomson, and Pope expressed the same
idea even more slickly when he announced in his <i>Essay
on Man</i>: “Whatever is, is right.” Thus, rapt in adoration
of the radiant new lady, the poets lost all interest
in dame Nature. Only when she was arranged and
regulated and organized into a park or a landscape
garden would they consent to have anything to do with
her, and then it was chiefly as a foil to the superior
attractions of her rival. She became a stage, a
“pleasing” background to a sort of everlasting human
boxing-match between reason and “the passions”;
and the dictionary dates from this time our curious
custom of describing her face as <i>scenery</i>. And then,
after having quietly murdered her, poetry proceeded
to galvanize the poor corpse into a shameful,
marionette-like semblance of life by switching into it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
that supposititious <i>personal</i> sympathy with human
affairs which mars so much of the verse of the
eighteenth century. We can, however, mark the
beginning of this practice at an earlier date.</p>

<p>The word <i>conscious</i>, like <i>consciousness</i>, was unknown
until the seventeenth century, when its newfangledness
was ridiculed by Ben Jonson. It is odd, therefore,
that the first recorded uses are figurative, applying
it to inanimate objects. When we find Denham writing
in 1643:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thence to the coverts and the conscious Groves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scenes of his past Triumphs and his Loves....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and Milton a few years later:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Secret they finishèd....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we can almost fancy, by their readiness to seize upon
the new word, that our poets were beginning, even
so soon, to feel the need of restoring “subjectively”
to external Nature—of “projecting into” her, as we
can now say—a fanciful substitute for that voluntary
life and inner connection with human affairs which
Descartes and Hobbes were draining from her in reality.
The tendency we can see here, carried to extravagant
lengths, at last produced the extraordinary poetic
conventions of the eighteenth century, by which
fictitious personality was attributed to every object
and idea under the sun. Finally the complicated
machinery of classical mythology was applied in the
same subjective and purely fanciful way to English
society and the English countryside. It is in the
same Windsor Forest that we are asked to</p>

<p>At first sight this state of affairs looks like an exact
repetition of the later stages of Roman mythology,
but in point of fact the two outlooks are sharply
distinguished by the new element of self-consciousness.
Myth was in some way in the blood of the Romans;
it was a living part of their national history, and in
spite of all their artificiality and scepticism there is
no evidence that they ever deliberately created gods
and goddesses of the fancy, in whom they neither
believed themselves nor expected anyone else to believe.
We imagine them incapable of grasping, for instance,
such an idea as that which found expression in the
brand-new eighteenth-century verb, to <i>personify</i>. One
wonders, therefore, to what extent the dawn of a
mechanical age was reflecting itself in this new outlook,
this new cosmos controlled by dead laws rather than
instinct with living spirit, and therefore requiring to
be peopled by the fancy.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the eighteenth-century mind
as living in a “clockwork” cosmos, and it is interesting
to reflect that even this simplest form of mechanical
contrivance was a thing quite unknown to the ancient
world. Was the rhythmical mimicry of organic life,
which is the characteristic of machinery, already
having its unperceived effect on men’s minds and
philosophies? The influences which go to make up
the outlook of an age are sometimes seen working
most powerfully—though beneath the surface—in
the very minds which believe themselves to be combating
that outlook most stubbornly. The closing years
of the eighteenth century produced Paley’s famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
watch, a popular cosmic allegory which, in proving
the existence of a Creator, at the same time relegates
all His activities to the remote past. But this is a
subject which can be more usefully considered in the
next chapter. Thither we must now turn in order to
trace the further development of the eighteenth-century
gentleman’s imaginative double life—his life
in the order and reason of the moral and material
universe and of “sensibility” in the little universe of
himself—into two divergent directions.</p>

<p>“Whatever else a child may be, in respect of this particular
question [respiration], it is a complicated piece of
mechanism, built up out of materials supplied by its
mother; and in the course of such building-up, provided
with a set of motors—the muscles. Each of these muscles
contains a stock of substance capable of yielding energy
under certain conditions, one of which is a change of state
in the nerve fibres connected with it. The powder in a

yielding energy in consequence of a change of state in the

<p class="p1 drop-capy">The two most interesting points about the above
passage are firstly, that it was written, not by an
engineer, but by a natural scientist; and secondly,
that the title of the essay from which it is taken is
<cite>Capital and Labour</cite>. That is to say, the abundance
of mechanical simile in it is neither the natural
colouring of an imagination subdued to what it works
in, nor a deliberate system of metaphors fabricated
with the object of figuring forth a biological process
to the uninitiated. On the contrary, the notion of
child-birth is itself only introduced for the purpose
of illustration. The images by which it is conveyed
are thus revealed as the natural furniture of the writer’s
imagination. They can no longer have been images
to him, but rather his normal outlook on the chain
of facts in which he was most interested; and the
passage is, of course, only one of thousands in which
we can see nineteenth-century imagination working
in a similar way.</p>

<p>It would be of small general interest to give a list
of all the mechanical and technical words which had
come into our vocabulary since the middle of the
seventeenth century—words like <i>calculus</i>, <i>centrifugal</i>,
<i>dynamic</i>, <i>galvanize</i>, <i>inertia</i>, <i>momentum</i>, <i>oscillate</i>, <i>polarity</i>,
<i>reciprocating</i>, <i>rotate</i>, <i>vibrate</i> (except in the sense ‘to
brandish’),<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>... We are concerned more with
their influence on the meanings of older words.
And from this point of view the passage quoted from
Huxley can indeed give us a fair idea of the untold
changes that were secretly brewing when, for instance,
the word <i>mechanic</i> (Greek ‘mēchanē’, a ‘device’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
or ‘contrivance’) lost its old meaning of ‘pertaining
to manual labour’, and began to be applied to
machines. This happened in the seventeenth century,
when also the word <i>machine</i>, which had formerly been
used of plots and intrigues, or for any kind of erection,
was first used with its modern meaning. We begin to
hear of the six “Mechanick Faculties” or “Simple
Machines”, i.e. the <i>Balance</i>, <i>Lever</i>, <i>Pulley</i>, <i>Screw</i>,
<i>Wedge</i>, and <i>Wheel</i>; and in a little book called <cite>Mathematicall
Magick</cite>, by Bishop Wilkins, one of the first
members of the Royal Society, these are discussed
with great enthusiasm and many respectful references
to Aristotle. It is in the same work that we first hear
in English of a science of <i>Mechanics</i>. This new science,
foreshadowed to some extent by Aristotle, from whose
treatise with that title we take the word, had quickly
been carried farther by his successor, Archimedes.
Most civilizations seem to have produced towards their
close mechanical devices of one kind or another, but
more especially “engines” of war. What distinguishes
our own is the way in which mechanism has
gradually entered into our outlook—a fact which is
marked, among other things, by our use of the Greek
prefix ‘auto-’ (self) for things worked by machinery.
In a Greek dictionary we find upwards of two hundred
words beginning with this prefix, but not one of them
is applied to anything mechanical.</p>

<p>Let us consider the word <i>automatic</i>. The Greek
‘automatos’, which meant ‘self-moved’,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> was Latinized
in the form ‘automatus’ at about the beginning
of our era, and <i>automatous</i>—now obsolete—is
actually found in the works of the seventeenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
writer, Sir Thomas Browne. This old adjective
had the sense of “spontaneous”, “of one’s own
free will”, and was used of the animal and vegetable
worlds as opposed to the mineral, or of events which
came about “by chance”; while in Plato’s philosophy
the distinction between that which is “self-moved”,
and that which can only be moved by something outside
itself had been taken as the very antithesis between
spirit and matter, between eternal and perishable.
<i>Automatic</i> is first found in English in the eighteenth
century. The earliest quotation given by the <cite>Oxford
Dictionary</cite> is taken from David Hartley, who wrote
in 1748:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The motions of the body are of two kinds, automatic
and voluntary. The automatic motions are those which
arise from the mechanism of the body in an evident manner.
They are called automatic from their resemblance to the
motions of automata, or machines, whose principle of
motion is within themselves. Of this kind are the motions
of the heart and peristaltic motion of the bowels.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1802 Paley pointed out “the difference between
an animal and an automatic statue”, and sixty years
later a writer on physics, after speaking of the amoeba
as being “irritable and automatic”, added a note
to the effect that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Automatic ... has recently acquired a meaning
almost exactly opposite to that which it originally bore,
and an automatic action is now by many understood to
mean nothing more than an action produced by some
machinery or other. In this work I use it in the older
sense, as denoting an action of a body, the causes of which
appear to lie in the body itself.</p>
</div>

<p>The reason for this semantic <i lang="fr">volte face</i> may perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
be detected in the history of the parallel word
<i>automaton</i>. This had long ago (about 10 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) been
applied to the few primitive mechanical devices which
Aryan civilization had then evolved, and its appearance
in English seems to have preceded that of <i>automatic</i>
by nearly two centuries, as it is found in 1611 describing
“a picture of a gentlewoman” made with eyes that
open and shut. Then, later on in the same century,
it began to be applied to clocks and watches, and there
seems every reason to suppose that the presence of
this particular kind of apparent “self-mover” on so
many mantelpieces and in so many vest-pockets must
have determined the peculiarly dead and mechanical
meaning which <i>automatic</i> now possesses.</p>

<p>The ancients measured time by the regulated flow
of water. Striking clocks of some kind were known
in Europe as far back as the twelfth or thirteenth
century. But they seem to have been unreliable,
costly, and rare until the discovery by Galileo of the
“isochronism” of pendulums. <i>Pendulum</i> is first
found in 1660, in Boyle’s writings, <i>vibrate</i> and <i>vibration</i>
in 1667. The new toy seems to have taken hold of
Europe’s imagination in the most extraordinary way.
Both <i>clockwork</i> and <i>mainspring</i> were used figuratively
the first time they are known to have been used in
English at all, a sixteenth-century writer even anticipating
Paley so far as to write:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">God’s the main spring, that maketh every way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the small wheels of this great Engin play.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We hear talk almost at once of the <i>springs</i><a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> of people’s
actions. Descartes compared the souls of brutes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
watches, and Leibnitz actually compared the souls
and bodies of men to <em>two</em> watches! It seems as though
the works had started going in our heads.</p>

<p>And since then, so far from stopping, they have
accelerated, especially during the last century—to
what extent it is difficult for us to realize fully, simply
because it has all happened so recently. Differences
of outlook on such matters as biology and physiology
between ourselves and the Middle Ages we readily
perceive, though we may not properly understand
them; here we stand a long way off, and can often see
quite plainly how the old words have altered their
meanings. But from the way in which our great
grandfathers used such words as <i>energy</i>, <i>midriff</i>, <i>motor</i>,
<i>muscle</i>, <i>nerve</i>, <i>respiration</i>, <i>work</i>—to take examples only
from the passage quoted at the beginning of <a href="#CHAPTER_X">this
chapter</a>—we sometimes find it hard, even when we
have traced the history of their meanings up to that
date, to feel what different associations they must
have called up to the generations which died before
Huxley was born. At this time, thirty years after
his death, it is only our own imagination, working
introspectively on such a phrase as “nervous
machinery”, and grasping, as it can do, how the
meanings of the two words have been running into
one another, which can bring this difference before us.
When it has done so, we are again reminded of the
simple yet striking truth that all knowledge which has
been conveyed by means of speech to the reason has
travelled in metaphors taken from man’s own activities
and from the solid things which he handles. The
present is no different from the past. Only the
metaphors get buried deeper and deeper beneath one
another; they interact more subtly, and do not
always leave any <em>outward</em> trace on the language. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
would be interesting, for example, were it possible,
to discover just how much of the average man’s idea
of blood circulation is due to the invention of that
elementary mechanical device, the pump;<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> or how
much of the mental image which he has formed of the
interaction of muscle, nerve, and brain would fade
from his consciousness if there were no such thing as
the electric telegraph.</p>

<p>We think by means of words, and we have to use
the same ones for so many different thoughts that as
soon as new meanings have entered into one set, they
creep into all our theories and begin to mould our
whole cosmos; and from the theories they pass into
more words, and so into our lives and institutions.
Thus, not only were the Newtonian heavens the playground
of just those forces which had been used for
the working of the six “simple machines”, but
Montesquieu insists that the English Whigs copied
the new astronomy when they were creating the
modern British Constitution. Referring to this in one
of his essays, Woodrow Wilson drew attention to the
fact that the Constitution of the United States had
been made on the same principle. “They [writers in
the <cite>Federalist</cite>] speak of the <i>checks</i> and <i>balances</i> of the
Constitution,” he said, “and use to express their idea
the simile of the organization of the universe, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
particularly of the solar system....” And we
notice that the late President, when he went on to
speak of reconstructing the Constitution, was fain to
lean on another analogy, reminding his hearers that
government is “not a machine, but a living thing”;
that it is “modified by its environment, necessitated
by its tasks, shaped to its functions by the sheer
pressure of life”; and again that it is a body of men
“with highly differentiated functions”. In fact, we
are merely launched into another set of metaphors,
of which, however, the speaker is in this case conscious,
for he explicitly affirms that government is “accountable
to Darwin, not to Newton”.</p>

<p><i>Environment</i>, <i>evolution</i>, <i>development</i>, <i>instinct</i>, <i>species</i>,
<i>spontaneous</i>, <i>variation</i> are some of the more important
words, whose modern meanings, if we look at their
semantic history, are found to bear the unmistakable
stamp of Darwinism, and we ought perhaps to add
<i>ooze</i><a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and <i>slime</i>.<a id="FNanchor_59a" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> To Darwin we should have to
attribute the tendency of <i>evolution</i> to lose its etymological
suggestion of a vegetable growth, an unfolding
from the centre outwards. <i>Species</i> (Latin ‘species’,
‘form’ or ‘appearance’) was used by Cicero to translate
Plato’s “Idea” (<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>). It held an important
place in the logic of the Middle Ages as one of the
five “predicables” by which an object could be
defined, and for centuries its biological meaning was
only one among many. This particular interpretation
did not begin to come into prominence until the
eighteenth century, when Addison, for instance, used
the phrase “the species” of the human race; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
since Darwin published his <cite>Origin of Species</cite> (in which
the word is, of course, given an exclusively biological
sense) it has, for the ordinary man, had practically
no other. It is interesting to observe that here again,
as the words are commonly employed, the Latin form
has grown more concrete and the Greek more abstract
and intellectual.</p>

<p>But the change did not confine itself to such technical
words as these. One has only to pick up a journalistic
article on almost any subject and read it, endeavouring
to let the words mean only what they did a hundred
years ago, to see how the whole scheme of Natural
Selection can lurk unseen, but not unfelt, behind some
colourless little word like <i>adapt</i>, <i>competition</i>, <i>gregarious</i>,
<i>modification</i>, <i>protective</i>, <i>selection</i>, and even <i>animal</i>, <i>facts</i>,
<i>law</i>, <i>life</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>Nature</i>,... Or we can see it in the
curious, absolute use of the word <i>fit</i>, in the sense of
‘physically healthy’, which, appearing first in the
seventies, is obviously due to the famous phrase, the
“survival of the fittest” (i.e. the fittest to survive
in a struggle for existence). How modern the new
meanings are may be gauged by the fact that the
word <i>heredity</i>, the basic principle of modern natural
scientific theory, is recorded by Francis Galton as
having been considered “fanciful and unusual” in
1859, while <i>atavism</i> first appears in 1833.</p>

<p>But when a little more time has elapsed and the
nineteenth century can be properly studied from the
semantic point of view, there is little reason to doubt
that the interfusion of mechanical and biological
conceptions and the penetration of both into meaning
will present one of its most striking features. One
of the greatest triumphs of mechanism—greater than
the Forth Bridge or the St. Gothard Tunnel—is the
fact that it has wormed itself into the meaning of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
the word <i>cause</i>. This is, of course, a word which tends
to alter its meaning a little every time it is used, and
there is evidence that in former times, while there
were separate words to express such separate ideas
as “bringing to birth”, “making to grow”, “being
guilty of”, ... there was no general term into which
the one single essence common to all these relations
had been distilled. The Greek and Latin words for
<i>cause</i>, for example, were both closely connected
from the earliest times with their legal procedure
(cf. <i>ac-cuse</i>, etc., and the modern use of <i>cause</i> in the
same sense). At some period, however—perhaps in the
last two centuries before our era—such a concept must
have been precipitated, and we find Cicero defining
the Latin ‘causa’, with mathematical precision, simply
as ‘that which effects the thing of which it is the
cause’. The fascination which this abstraction
exerted on the medieval imagination may be judged
from the fact that the writer of a fifteenth-century
treatise on Love introduced into it the sentence:
“Every cause of a cause is cause of thing caused”;
and we soon find the philosophers seeking through
a “chain” of causes for that First Cause, which
they identified with the Almighty. By the nineteenth
century this thought-system of an abstract
<i>causality</i>, brought about by means of abstract
“laws”, lay, like an empty house, ready to be
taken over by a new owner. The new owner was
mechanism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The great abstract law of mechanical causality”
(<span lang="de">mechanischen kausalität</span>), wrote Haeckel in 1899,
“now rules the entire universe, as it does the mind of
man. It is the steady, immutable pole-star, whose clear
light falls on our path through the dark labyrinth of the
countless separate phenomena.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Under its influence even consciousness itself was,
and still is, often conceived of as being <i>caused</i> by
mechanical movements taking place within the body.
We also find thought described as a <em>function</em> of the
brain. This curious word had become extremely
popular; and somewhere about the sixties the noun
began to be used as a verb. We hear of nerves,
brain, heart, ... <i>functioning</i> or refusing to <i>function</i>,
an expression in which the mechanical flavour is
especially strong.</p>

<p>Thus, in the light of words, the historical relation
between mechanics and physiology looks not unlike
that relation between mathematics and astronomy
which was suggested in a previous chapter. We drew
from out our own bodies, it would seem, the sense-experiences
of <i>force</i> and <i>pressure</i> and the like,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> on
which mechanics are based; then we externalized
them in tools and machines, and turned them into
abstract “laws”; finally, we proceeded to re-apply
the “laws” to the familiar objects from which we
had first extracted them, and the result was that we
turned our previous notions of these inside out. For
the typical intellectual position towards the end of
the nineteenth century was exactly the reverse of the
typical Academic position. Plato had deduced the
sense-world from what we have called the inner world,
and, while he had worked out an elaborate and wise
knowledge of this inner world, with its moral impulses
and aspirations, his philosophy had remained admittedly
bankrupt as far as detailed knowledge of the
mechanism of the outer world was concerned. Nineteenth-century
science, on the other hand, deduced
the inner from the outer; it had mapped and charted
the mechanical part of Nature to a tenth of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
millimetre,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
but it was <ins class="corr" id="tn-178" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'wellnigh bankrupt'">
well-nigh bankrupt</ins> as far as the
inner world was concerned. Huxley invented the
word <i>agnostic</i> (not-knowing) to express his own
attitude, and that of many millions since his day, to
the nature and origin of all this part of the cosmos.
One of the few things about which practically all
“men of science”, as the phrase now went, besides
all those laymen who took the trouble to follow out
the various scientific discoveries and to listen to their
metaphysical reverberations, were agreed upon was
that his senses and his reason had succeeded in placing
man in a material environment which appeared to
bear no relation whatever to his inner feelings and
moral impulses.</p>

<p>For the expression of these, his proper humanity,
he continued, irrespective of his conscious belief, to
live on what had been developed through Plato and
the Gospels, the Church and the poets. For it was
these, as we have seen, which had built up the meanings
of those old words in terms of which he learnt to think
and feel about his fellow-men. Whenever the biologico-mechanical
meanings did creep into human
relationships—as, for example, into the economic
relationship through the word <i>competition</i> and otherwise—the
result was, almost without exception, disastrous.
The famous Encyclical Letter and Syllabus
of 1864, in which modern movements of thought were
condemned and anathematized wholesale from the
Vatican, was thus in some sense an attempt to express
in dogmatic form a principle which was, in fact, already
active throughout Europe. And the pathetic impotence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
of this papal gesture probably marks the maximum
point of that divergence between science and religion,
as modes of experience, which first became noticeable
in the Alexandrian world, and of which nineteenth-century
philosophy had become sufficiently conscious
to create the word <i>Dualism</i>.</p>

<p>The rapid conquest of intellectual Europe, which
was achieved, not only by the general idea of evolution,
but by the particular Darwinian theory of mechanical
natural selection, is a matter of some surprise when
we consider that a full acceptance of it necessitated
a reversal of practically every metaphysical idea and
feeling likely to be present in a nineteenth-century
soul. No doubt one could point to a variety of causes.
There is evidence, for instance, in a certain class of
word which had recently begun to multiply that even
in Protestant countries the custodians of the ancient
outlook were not always fortresses of wisdom and
enlightenment. <i>Religionism</i> appears towards the close
of the eighteenth century, and then <i>religiosity</i> (in a
bad sense),<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and in the next century the now obsolete
<i>religiose</i>. The word <i>pious</i>, which had long been
degenerating towards an imputation of feeble-mindedness,
formed an unpleasant derivative, <i>pietism</i>, which
in turn produced its adjective <i>pietistic</i>; and in 1864—an
appropriate year—we first come up against
<i>clericalism</i>. <i>Unction</i>—the name of one of the deepest
mysteries of the Catholic Church—is first recorded
by the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> with an offensive
meaning in 1870, when Lowell writes of “that
clerical unction which in a vulgar nature so easily
degenerates into greasiness”. <i>Unctuous</i> was not long
in following suit, and instances could no doubt be
multiplied. The extension towards the priesthood of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
this particular shade of disapproval seems to have
been the product of the age. Possibly the single
earlier example is the old word <i>cant</i>, which dates
back to the Middle Ages, and is said to have been
born of exasperation at the whining tone adopted by
the mendicant friars in their “chants” (cantare).
In the same way may we not suppose that the words
quoted above grew up out of that extraordinary
atmosphere of partly bovine, partly hypocritical,
acquiescence in obsolete dogma which Stuart Mill hit
off in his famous phrase<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we should have to look deeper than
all this for the true causes of a change of outlook as
rapid and emphatic as that which swept through the
last century. If we did so, we should probably discern,
as one of the most efficient, that vivid sense of orderliness
and <i>arrangement</i> which had grown up during
the eighteenth century, the reverence for Reason, and
especially for Reason reflected<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in the impartial laws
which govern the working of Nature. To minds thus
attuned direct intervention by the divine at any one
point in the natural process could only seem like an
intolerable liberty; and feeling as well as thought
began to revolt at the conjuring-tricks apparently
reported in the Gospels. Perhaps there is a faint
indication of the new point of view in the nineteenth-century
use of the word <i>freak</i> to describe a <i>lusus
naturae</i>, instead of the old <i>monster</i>, which is derived
from the Latin ‘moneo’, and implies that the oddity
is sent as a divine warning or portent.</p>

<p>The new cosmos—a complex of matter and forces
proceeding mechanically from spiral nebula to everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
ice—took such a firm hold on the imagination
of Europe that labels like <i>spiritualism</i>, <i>spiritualist</i>,
<i>spiritualistic</i><a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> were employed to describe those who
believed it was anything more, and even <i>Vitalism</i> and
<i>Vitalist</i> to distinguish those who held that life, as
such, had any purpose or significance. It is a curious
remark that the erection within men’s imaginations
of this severely mechanical framework for themselves
was accompanied by, and may have been partly
responsible for, an increase in their sense of self-consciousness.
The more automatic the cosmos,
apparently, the more the vital ego must needs
feel itself detached. At any rate, we find upwards
of forty words hyphened with <i>self</i> created in the
nineteenth century, and of these only about six
(<i>self-acting</i>, <i>self-regulating</i>, ...) are mechanical. Nor
was it only the material world from which men
felt themselves more aloof. Herbert Spencer remarked
on the recent extension of the meaning of
the word <i>phenomenon</i> to cover the thoughts of
human beings—a point of view which suggests an
increased degree of detachment even from thought
itself; and an enormous number of words with
terminations such as <i>-ism</i>, <i>-ist</i>, <i>-ite</i>, <i>-ology</i>, <i>-arian</i>, are
indications of a more contemplative attitude to all
that we ourselves do and feel and think. What a
difference between being <i>feminine</i> and being a <i>feminist</i>,
between <i>hope</i> and <i>optimism</i>, <i>romance</i> and <i>romanticism</i>,
between <i>Christianity</i> and <i>Christology</i>, between liking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
<i>vegetables</i> and being a <i>vegetarian</i>! We are hardly
conscious at all of being <i>human</i>, more of being <i>humane</i>,
more still of being <i>humanitarian</i>, and very conscious
indeed of being <i>humanitarianists</i>.</p>

<p>Detachment, however, spells freedom; and words
are not wanting to remind us of that enhanced sense
of the value of individual liberty which now found
expression in the writings of the great Romantics and
of men like John Stuart Mill. <i>Autonomy</i> had not
been applied to individuals, but only to states and
societies, until the close of the eighteenth century, and
in the following century the adjective <i>autonomous</i> was
introduced. We may compare <i>liberalism</i> and <i>liberal-minded</i>
with the old <i>libertine</i>; <i>authoritarian</i> implies
a feeling in him who uses the word that all authority,
as such, is bad; the nineteenth century also saw
the distinction between <i>broad-minded</i> and <i>narrow-minded</i>,
and between <i>obscurantism</i> and <i>enlightenment</i>—a
word which met with some opposition, according
to FitzEdward Hall, who records in his <i>Modern English</i>
(1873) that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Enlightenment is, to this day, always used by a
certain class of English writers with a manifest sneer.
The writers referred to are those who would rather have
been born under the rule of the barons than under the
inchoate rule of reason, and would gladly exchange the
age of science for the ages of faith and folly. Those
who object to the word will ordinarily be found to object
to all that it stands for.</p>
</div>

<p>Since the sense of freedom often appeared at its
strongest in imaginations which were most possessed
with the mechanical view of the universe, the paradox
was not infrequent—especially in Germany—of philosophers
and scientists insisting fiercely on the freedom
of thought and using it to deny the possibility of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
freedom at all! Such thinkers found the word
<i>Determinism</i> useful to express the mechanical part
of the old <i>predestination</i> without the latter’s theological
assumptions.</p>

<p>Other words which seem to be connected with the
same trend of thought are those that confine themselves
to expressing a sense of the worth and dignity of man,
<em>as</em> man, and irrespective of his cosmic connections.
Such are <i>humanism</i>,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> <i>humanitarian</i>,<a id="FNanchor_66a" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> <i>humanitarianism</i>,
<i>individualism</i>, <i>individualist</i>, <i>individualistic</i>, and many
of the <i>self</i> words, such as Carlyle’s <i>self-help</i>, or the
semantic change of <i>self-respect</i>, which is first recorded
as used with a praiseworthy meaning in Wordsworth’s
<i>Prelude</i>. Now the consciousness of the absolute value
and infinite potentiality of each human soul is
revealed, as we saw, by the words in which it first
began to take verbal form, as having been essentially
an attribute of Christianity. Yet how differently
these nineteenth-century words sound from the
Christian vocabulary of the human and social virtues—<i>charity</i>,
<i>lovingkindness</i>, <i>mercy</i>, <i>pity</i>, and the like!
The modern words seem to be related to these glowing
old Christian terms as the unemphasized, because
unquestioned, mutual affection of a happy couple is
related to the voluble ardours of courting. They
preserve, we may say—they have even greatly
developed—that divine sense of the value and autonomy
of each individual human soul. But it is now more
of a <em>political</em> autonomy. It is as though they respected
it rather from a manly sense of obligation, and the
sense of obligation is even extended, as we see in the
later semantic development of <i>humane</i>, <i>humanity</i>, and
<i>humanitarian</i>, to the brutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>Thus, if the one outlook is indeed a lineal descendant
of the other, we are constrained to ask a little sadly
what had become of a certain sunny element, a
suppressed poetic energy, a wonder and a wild
surprise, which lurks in the former words, but somehow—with
all our respect for them—not in the latter.
And for light upon this question we must turn to yet
another group of words—small, yet of such far-reaching
implications as to demand a final chapter to themselves.</p>

<p class="drop-capy">Early Christianity, with its delighted recognition
of the soul’s reality, its awful consciousness of
inner depths unplumbed, had produced, as we saw,
many words describing human emotions by their
<em>effects</em>, and especially by their effects on the soul’s
relation to the Divine. In the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, with the increase of self-consciousness
among the leisured classes, a more sympathetic,
“introspective”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> attitude to the emotions grew up,
and this we traced to its development in the romantic
<em>sensibility</em> of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
How did it fare, then, with this tender nursling in the
years that followed? Was it crushed and dissected
into a neatly labelled little corpse, or was it suffered
to grow up unchecked, uneducated, into the middle-aged
and well-fed <em>sentimentalism</em> of our Victorian
ancestors? Fortunately it avoided both these fates.
Carefully tended by small groups of earnest men, now
in this academy and now in that, it had escaped the
dissection of Nature because it had learned not to draw
its nourishment from Nature and the God of Nature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
but from man himself. And on this diet it had thriven
and waxed until it was a veritable young giant, able
to stand up and confront Nature as her equal. But
we must retrace our steps a little.</p>

<p>Attentive readers of Jane Austen’s novels will have
noticed the slightly unfamiliar way in which she
employs the two words <i>romantic</i> and <i>picturesque</i>.
A closer examination reveals the fact that in her
time they still bore traces of their origin. These
adjectives are taken from the arts, <i>romantic</i> meaning
in the first instance ‘like the old Romances’, and
<i>picturesque</i> ‘like a picture’ or ‘reminding one of a
picture.’ They are thus members of a quite considerable
group of words and phrases, <i>attitude</i>, <i>comic</i>,
<i>dramatic</i>, <i>lyrical</i>, <i>melodramatic</i>, <i>point of view</i>, and the like,
in which terms taken in the first place from the arts are
subsequently applied to life. Nowadays we sometimes
go farther and use the name of a particular artist,
speaking, for instance, of a <i>Turneresque</i> sunset, a
<i>Praxitelean</i> shape; or we even call to our aid a writer’s
fictitious creatures, as in “<i>Falstaffian</i> morality”,
“the <i>Pickwickian</i> sense”,... Such a figure of speech
looks at first sight like any other kind of imagery,
and we perhaps imagine it in use since the beginnings
of art. In point of fact, however, it is probable that
it was not known before the time of the Renaissance,
when men’s notions of art changed so suddenly,
when, indeed, their very consciousness of it as a
separate, unrelated activity, something which can
be distinguished in thought from a “craft”, a “trade”,
or a religious ceremony, seems to have first sprung
into being. Moreover, the ancient word <i>art</i> used
to include in its purview not only these meanings,
but also most of those which we now group under the
heading <i>science</i>. In the Middle Ages the Seven Liberal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Arts<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>—<i>Grammar</i>, <i>Logic</i>, <i>Rhetoric</i>, <i>Arithmetic</i>, <i>Geometry</i>,
<i>Music</i>, and <i>Astronomy</i>—were contrasted with the
“servile” or “mechanical” arts—that is, handicrafts
involving manual labour. And thus, though <i>art</i> in
this wide sense is old, <i>artist</i> first occurs in Sir Philip
Sidney’s <i>Apologie for Poetry</i>. <i>Artisan</i> appeared at
about the same time, and was not then, as now,
confined to mechanical and manual labourers.</p>

</div>

<p>In the light of two or three familiar words let us
try and trace the development, from Sidney’s time
onwards, of some of our modern notions of “art”, and
in particular of poetry. Criticism—the branch of
literature or journalism with which our daily and
weekly reviews make us so familiar—does not date
very far back into the past. Its parents were the
medieval arts of grammar and philology, which, among
the commentators on classical texts, had already
sometimes blossomed into the rudiments of aesthetic.
The actual words <i>critic</i> and <i>critical</i>, however, have
been traced no farther back than Shakespeare; <i>critic</i>
in its aesthetic sense is first found in Bacon; and
<i>criticism</i> and <i>criticize</i> are neither of them earlier than
the seventeenth century. Based for the most part
on Aristotle’s <cite>Poetics</cite>, serious criticism began to
take shape in England at the Renaissance. From
Elizabethan critical essays, such as Sidney’s <cite>Apologie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
for Poetry</cite>, we can get an idea of the light in which
poetry and the other arts had begun to be viewed at
that time. To Sidney, for example, the distinguishing
mark of poetry was, not metre, but a certain “feigning.”
The first philosophers and historians, he affirmed,
were also poets, not indeed because of what we should
magnificently call their “creative imagination”, but
simply because they “invented” certain fictitious
persons and events. We should not now regard this
as a virtue in an historian. Sidney, however, points
out the derivation of <i>poetry</i> from the Greek ‘poiein’,
‘to make’,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and shows how this distinguishes it from
all the other arts and sciences, which in the last
analysis merely “follow Nature”, while only the
poet,</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>disdaining to be tied to any such subjection, lifted with
the vigour of his own invention, doth grow in effect another
nature, in making things either better than Nature bringeth
forth, or, quite anew, forms such as never were in Nature,
as the Heroes, Demigods, Cyclops, Chimeras, Furies, and
such like: so as he goeth hand in hand with Nature, not
enclosed within the narrow warrant of her gifts, but freely
ranging only within the Zodiac of his own wit.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Sidney adds that this fact is not to be made light
of merely because the works of Nature are “essential”
while the poet’s are only “in imitation or fiction”.
The poet has contemplated the “Ideas” behind Nature,
and it is those which he “delivers forth, as he hath
imagined them”. With ten or twenty new novels
appearing on the bookstalls every week it is not so
easy for us to realize the dignity and glory which were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
once felt to distinguish this great human achievement
of <i>fiction</i>—that is, of ‘making’ or ‘making up’
(from the Latin ‘fingere’, to ‘form’ or ‘make’) purely
imaginary forms, instead of merely copying Nature.</p>

<p>Now the presence of a made-up element, especially
when it comprised supernatural beings such as giants
and fairies, was held to be one of the distinguishing
marks of a <i>romance</i>. The old medieval romances,
as their name suggests, had been nursed to life in
that curious period of contact between Roman and
Celtic myth which also gave us such words as <i>fairy</i>
and <i>sorcery</i>.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They were so called because they
were written or recited in the <i>romance</i> vernacular<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
instead of in literary Latin, and they seem to have
developed out of an increasing tendency among the
medieval bards to embroider, on their own responsibility,
the traditional accounts of historical and
mythical events. This tendency, wherever it had
hitherto been detected among the western Aryans,
had been strenuously opposed in the interests of learning
and morality. It was one of the reasons why Plato
decided to expel poets from his Republic, and it is
remarkable that the earlier uses of a word like <i>fable</i> in
twelfth- and thirteenth-century French and fourteenth-century
English should have been all condemnatory.
Now by the time the Renaissance dawned on England
this word had come to be applied, in one instance at
least, not merely to the embroidery, but to the garment
itself, so that, for example, the whole prodigious
fabric of classical mythology might be implicit in
the disparaging phrase “fables of poets”. And
after the Revival of Learning, when the most able
men began to have a very different feeling towards
the myths of Greece and Rome, such a phrase became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the very opposite of disparaging. <i>Fiction</i> and <i>romance</i>
were gradually recognized as a legitimate and noble
expression of the human spirit.</p>

<p>Gradually: to Sidney, poetry was still, after Aristotle’s
definition, “an art of imitation”; only poets must
“to imitate, borrow nothing of what is, hath been, or
shall be, but range ... into the divine consideration
of what may be and should be”. And during the
seventeenth century all art continued to be regarded
as imitation, of which, however, there were two kinds—the
imitation of other arts and the imitation of Nature
herself. The second kind, by analogy from picture-dealing,
was called <i>original</i>, and the faculty which
achieved it was named <i>invention</i> (Latin, ‘invenire’,
‘to find’), a word implying that something had
been found in Nature which had not <i>yet</i> been
imitated by man. Early in the eighteenth century
the substantive <i>originality</i> was formed from <i>original</i>,
and an increasing importance began to be attached to
the element of novelty in experiences of all kinds,
Addison placing it on a level with greatness and beauty
as a source of pleasure to the imagination.</p>

<p>At the same time another word appeared in the
vocabulary of aesthetic criticism. An Elizabethan
critic had already pointed out that, if poets could
indeed spin their poetry entirely out of themselves
they were as “<i>creating</i> gods”, and Dryden soon used
the same verb of Shakespeare, because, in Caliban,
he had <i>invented</i> “a person not in Nature”. So also
Addison:</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>... this Talent of affecting the Imagination ... has
something in it like Creation: It bestows a kind of Existence,
and draws up to the Reader’s View several Objects
which are not to be found in Being. It makes Additions
to Nature, and gives greater Variety to God’s Works.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">This word, too, with its derivative <i>creative</i>, is used
far too often and too lightly<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> now to allow us to easily
perceive its importance. ‘Creare’ was one of those
old Latin words which had been impregnated through
the Septuagint and the Vulgate with Hebraic and
Christian associations; its constant use in ecclesiastical
Latin had saturated it with the special meaning of
<i>creating</i>, in divine fashion, out of nothing, as opposed
to the merely human <i>making</i>, which signified the
rearrangement of matter already created, or the imitation
of “creatures”. The application of such a word
to human activities seems to mark a pronounced change
in our attitude towards ourselves, and it is not surprising
that, in the course of its career, the new use should
have met with some opposition on the grounds of
blasphemy.</p>

<p>Once established, however, the conception evidently
reacted on other terms embodying theories of art,
such, for example, as <i>original</i> and <i>originality</i> (already
mentioned), <i>art</i>, <i>artist</i>, <i>genius</i>, <i>imagination</i>, <i>inspiration</i>,
<i>poesy</i>, <i>poetry</i>, and others. The meaning which <i>inspiration</i>
possessed up to the seventeenth or eighteenth
centuries carries us right back to the old mythical
outlook in Greece and elsewhere, when poets and
prophets were understood to be the direct mouthpieces
of superior beings—beings such as the Muses, who
inspired or “breathed into” them the divine afflatus.
Through Plato and Aristotle this conception came to
England at the Renaissance and lasted as an element
of aesthetic theory well on into the eighteenth century,
if it can be said to have died out altogether even now.
But, like so many other words, this one began in the
seventeenth century to suffer that process which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
have called “internalization”. Hobbes poured etymologically
neat scorn on the senseless convention “by
which a man, enabled to speak wisely from the principles
of Nature and his own meditation, loves rather to be
thought to speak by inspiration, like a Bagpipe”.
And we may suppose that from about this time <i>inspiration</i>,
like some of the “character” words which we
traced in a previous chapter, began to lose its old
literal meaning and to acquire its modern and metaphorical
one. Like <i>instinct</i>, it was now felt, whatever
its real nature, to be something arising from within
the human being rather than something instilled from
without.</p>

<p>Such a revised notion of the immediate source of
human activities inevitably concentrated attention on
the individual artist—a fact which may perhaps be
reflected in the use from the seventeenth century
onwards of the word <i>genius</i> to describe not merely
the “creative” faculty, but its possessor. For we
can speak now of such and such a man being “a
<i>genius</i>”. This little word, on which a whole chapter
might be written, comes from the Latin ‘genius’<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
(from ‘gign-o’, ‘to bring into being’, a stem
appearing also in <i>ingenious</i>, <i>engine</i>, ...), which in
Roman mythology meant a person’s tutelary spirit,
or special angel attending him everywhere and influencing
his thoughts and actions. Its early meaning
in English was much the same as that of <i>talent</i>,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> which,
of course, takes its meaning from the New Testament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
parable. That is to say, <i>genius</i> signified an ability
implanted in a man by God at his birth. But from
about the seventeenth century this meaning began
to ferment and expand in the most extraordinary
way; it was distinguished from, and even opposed to,
<i>talent</i>, and in the following century its force and
suggestiveness were much enhanced by the use which
was made of it to translate the Arabic ‘Djinn’, a
powerful supernatural being. Although nowadays we
generally distinguish this particular sense by the
spelling <i>Genie</i>, the temporary fusion of meanings
certainly deepened the strength and mystery of the
older word, and may even have procreated the later
Byronic tradition of mighty, lonely <i>poets</i> with open
necks and long hair and a plethora of mistresses and
photographs.</p>

<p>Before, however, these words could acquire the
potent meanings which they bear to-day, they had to
run the gauntlet of the Age of Reason, with its hatred
of all enthusiasm and fanaticism. And it was out of
the ridicule and distrust which they encountered at
its hands that the important new epithet <i>romantic</i>,
together with some obsolete terms like <i>romancy</i>,
<i>romancical</i>, <i>romantical</i>, ... was born. With its meaning
of ‘like the old romances’ (and therefore barbarous,
fantastic), <i>romantic</i> was one of those adjectives, like
<i>enthusiastic</i>, <i>extravagant</i>, <i>Gothic</i>, by which the later
seventeenth, and the eighteenth century expressed their
disapproval of everything which did not bear the stamp
of reason and polite society. It was soon applied to
people whose heads were stuffed out with the ballooning
extravagancies of the old romances, just as <i>enthusiastic</i>
was employed to describe superstitious people
who believed themselves distended with a special
variety of divine inspiration. Above all, it had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
sense of fabulous, unreal, unnatural. “Can anything,”
asked Bishop South, “be imagined more profane
and impious, absurd, and indeed romantic?” But at
the beginning of the eighteenth century this meaning
developed a little farther. <i>Romantic</i> was now used
of places, or aspects of Nature, of the kind among which
the old Romances had been set. It was noticed that
“romantic” people displayed a preference for wild
landscapes and ruined castles, and would even “fancy”
these things, where more rational people could see
nothing more exciting than a tumbledown barn
and a dirty ditch. And it is this particular shade
of meaning, together with a strong suggestion of
absurdity and unreality, which the word seems still
to have conveyed to Jane Austen, who preferred
to use <i>picturesque</i> in contexts where we should now
employ <i>romantic</i> in its approving or non-committal
sense.</p>

<p>Had one of her heroines, however, succeeded in
emerging from that endless round of incredibly dull
activities which she contrives to make so incredibly
interesting, and had this enterprising young woman
then attempted to breast the intellectual currents of
the age, she would have been startled to find that
that sarcastic consciousness of a war between sense
and sensibility, which was her creator’s inspiration,
was a spent stream flowing from the remote past.
For while echoes of the original thinking of men like
Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke continued to rumble and
reverberate on in the disparaging implications carried
by a word like <i>romantic</i>, a new note had already
become audible beneath them as long ago as the
beginning of the century. It was an undertone of
reluctant approval. These “romantic” notions might
be absurd, but they were at least pleasant. “We do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
not care for seeing through the falsehood,” wrote
Addison, “and willingly give ourselves up to so agreeable
an imposture.”</p>

<p>It was in the second half of the eighteenth century
that this aesthetic<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> vocabulary—<i>genius</i>, <i>original</i>,
<i>romantic</i>, ...—whose meanings had up to the present
been developed largely by the English, began to make
a stir on the Continent. The words were talked of in
France; they were taken up by the critics, poets, and
philosophers of Germany; and after much handling
by men like Kant, Hegel, Schelling, Goethe, and others,
the further and partly popularized meanings which
they thus acquired were, in a sense, again inserted
into their English forms by one or two Englishmen
who, towards the close of the century, felt a strong
affinity between their own impulses and the <i>Sturm
und Drang</i> which had been agitating Germany. The
most influential of these was Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
and just before the turn of the century there burst,
with his help, upon England that strange explosion
which received, naturally enough, the name of the
Romantic Movement. At first it took the form of
a sort of cult of the Middle Ages. <i>Ballad</i> is another
word which added several cubits to its stature by
travelling in France and Germany, where it also gave
birth to the musical <i>ballade</i>; and we find medieval
words like <i>bard</i>, <i>foray</i>, <i>gramarye</i><a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> (and its Scotch
derivative, <i>glamour</i>), and <i>raid</i>, revived by Walter
Scott after having fallen out of use for two or three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
hundred years. <i>Derring-do</i>—another of these revivals—is
interesting because it originates in a mistake
made by Spenser about Chaucer. He had described
how Troilus was second to nobody in “daring do that
belongeth to a knight”—that is to say, “in daring to
do that which belongs to a knight”—or, in Cornish
idiom, “that which a knight ‘belongs to do’”. It
is easy to see the nature of Spenser’s error. The
mysterious substantive <i>derring-do</i> (desperate courage),
which he created and used several times, is not found
again until Scott’s <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>.</p>

<p>Very soon the Romantic Movement was resuscitating
the Elizabethan world as well as the “Gothic”—a
word, by the way, which now, for the first time in its
history, began to connote approval. It was Coleridge
himself who invented the word <i>Elizabethan</i>, and his
magnificent lectures on Shakespeare must be very
largely responsible for that renewed and deepened
interest in the great dramatist in which Germany
once more set us the example. It is also noteworthy
that the word <i>fitful</i>, which Shakespeare had probably
coined in the famous line from <cite>Macbeth</cite>, was never
used again until the close of the eighteenth century;
and another word which expired when the Elizabethan
spirit expired in Milton, to be resurrected in the
nineteenth century, is <i>faery</i>, with that spelling, and
with the meaning, not so much of an individual sprite
as of a magic realm or state of being—almost “the
whole supernatural element in romance”.</p>

<p>This supernatural element—as we saw in the history
of the words <i>creative</i> and <i>genius</i>—is connected very
intimately indeed with the origin of the Romantic
Movement. And we shall see the connection even
more clearly in the semantic development of two
more words—the last to be examined in this book—<i>fancy</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
and <i>imagination</i>. The various Greek words
which the Latin ‘imago’ was used to translate
acquired their special meanings among the Stoics,
where, as we saw in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>, that teasing sense of
a contrast, a lack of connection, between the “objective”
and “subjective” worlds appears first to have
developed. One of these words was ‘phantasia’,
from which we have taken indirectly the divergent
forms <i>fantasy</i>, <i>phantasy</i>, and <i>fancy</i>. By the third
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the Greek ‘phantasia’ was predominantly
used, so we are told, “in cases where, carried away by
enthusiasm and passion, you think you see what you
describe, and you place it before the eyes of your
hearers”.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> ‘Phantasia’ and ‘imaginatio’ were in
use among the Schoolmen, and <i>fantasy</i> and <i>imagination</i>
are both found in Chaucer in the sense of ‘a mental
image or reflection’, or more particularly ‘an image
of something which either has no real existence or
does not yet exist’. After the Renaissance Shakespeare
suddenly transfigured one of the two words
in one of those extraordinary passages which make us
feel that genius is indeed something more than earthly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">And as imagination bodies forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A local habitation and a name.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In such a passage we seem to behold him standing up,
a figure of colossal stature, gazing at us over the
heads of the intervening generations. He transcends
the flight of time and the laborious building up of meanings,
and, picking up a part of the outlook of an age
which is to succeed his by nearly two hundred years,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
gives it momentary expression before he lets it drop
again. That mystical conception which the word
embodies in these lines—a conception which would
make imagination the interpreter and part creator
of a whole unseen world—is not found again until
the Romantic Movement has begun.</p>

<p>And then it had to be reached slowly. Seventy
years after Shakespeare wrote we find the philosopher,
Henry More, cautiously distinguishing from other
kinds of imagination “that Imagination which is
most free, such as we use in Romantick Inventions”.
“Imagining”, wrote Dryden “is in itself the very
height and life of poetry”; and in 1712 Addison published
in the <i>Spectator</i> his papers on “The Pleasures of
the Imagination”, in which he used the two words
<i>fancy</i> and <i>imagination</i> synonymously, describing in
one of the essays how, because of the faculty of which
they are the names,</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>... our Souls are at present delightfully lost and bewildered
in a pleasing Delusion, and we walk about like
the inchanted Hero of a Romance, who sees beautiful
Castles, Woods and Meadows; and at the same time
hears the warbling of Birds, and the purling of Streams;
but upon the finishing of some secret Spell, the fantastic
Scene breaks up, and the disconsolate Knight finds himself
on a barren Heath, or in a solitary Desart.</p>
</div>

<p>The tendency among critics to use this sort of imagery,
or words suggestive of it, when writing of the
<i>fancy</i> and the <i>imagination</i>, rapidly increased. Dryden
had already distinguished the “fairy” way of writing,
and from Addison’s time we constantly hear writers
and their art referred to in terms of <i>fairyland</i>, <i>enchantments</i>,
<i>magic</i>, <i>spells</i>, <i>wands</i>,... Shakespeare, we are
told by one writer, is “a more powerful magician than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
his own Prospero”. “The world is worn out to us,”
wrote Young. “Where are its formerly sweet delusions,
its airy castles, and glittering spires?” And five
years later he assured us that “the pen of an original
writer, like Armida’s wand, out of a barren waste
calls a blooming spring”.</p>

<p>But as the Romantic impulse grew older and crystallized
into a philosophy—when the child which had
germinated, as feeling, among the ignorant many
who spoke the Romance languages, after passing
through its Elizabethan adolescence, achieved self-conscious
maturity, as thought, among the learned
few who were familiar with the complicated literary
languages of modern Europe—the need was felt for
some way of distinguishing what were merely “sweet
delusions” from the more eternal productions of
the Romantic spirit. And this Coleridge achieved
by his famous distinction between <i>fancy</i> and <i>imagination</i>.
<i>Fancy</i>, since his day, has meant rather the
power of inventing illustrative imagery—the playful
adornment, as it were, of Nature; but <i>imagination</i>
is the power of creating from within forms which themselves
become a part of Nature—“Forms”, as Shelley
put it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent2">more real than living man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nurslings of immortality.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The next step in the meaning of this word was
really taken on the day upon which Coleridge, with
his head full of ancient witchery, was introduced to
another poet with his heart full of mountains. Under
their joint influence we can behold that despised
habit of looking at life through the spectacles of
the old Romances, the mysterious faculty of superimposing
on Nature a magical colour or mood created<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
in the observer by the <em>fictions</em> of genius or the myths
of bygone ages, expanding until it includes the contemplation
of Nature impassioned by any effluence arising
from within—it may be emotion or it may be the
individual memory. It was the philosophy of the Lake
School that the perception of Nature—that is to say of
all in Nature that is not purely mechanical—depends
upon what is brought to it by the observer. Deep
must call unto deep. To a creation apprehended as
automatic by the senses and the reason, only <em>imagination</em>
could</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent22">Add the gleam,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The light that never was on sea or land;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">for imagination was “essentially vital, even as all
objects (<em>as</em> objects) are essentially fixed and dead”.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Imagination was, in fact, <em>organic</em>; and the application
of this adjective to the inner world has not been
traced farther back than Coleridge, who, in his lectures
on Shakespeare’s plays, emphasized the mistake of
confounding “mechanical regularity with organic
form”. But perhaps the most brilliant, even epigrammatic,
expression which has ever been given to the
everlasting war between the unconscious, because
creative, vital principle and the conscious, because
destructive, calculating principle, is contained in four
lines from a little poem of Wordsworth’s called <cite>The
Tables Turned</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweet is the lore which nature brings:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Our meddling intellect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We murder to dissect.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so it is in the philosophy and poetry of Romanticism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
that we first feel a true understanding, not indeed
of the process itself, but of the results of that process,
which has been traced in this book under the name of
“internalization”. Slowly the divers of the Romantic
expedition brought up to the surface of consciousness
that vast new cosmos which had so long been blindly
forming in the depths. It was a cosmos in which the
spirit and spontaneity of life had moved out of Nature
and into man. The magic of Persia, the Muses of
Greece, the witches and fairies and charms and enchantments
of Romance—all these had been locked
safely in man’s bosom, there to sleep until the trump
of Romanticism sounded its call to imagination to
give back their teeming life to Nature. “O Lady”,
wrote Coleridge in that most heartrending of all
poems, wherein, like the disconsolate knight awaking
on the barren heath, he reports the decay in himself
of this very power:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Lady! we receive but what we give,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in our life alone does nature live:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ours is her wedding-garment, ours her shroud!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And would we aught behold, of higher worth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than that inanimate cold world allowed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the poor loveless, ever-anxious crowd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Enveloping the Earth—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And from the soul itself must there be sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all sweet sounds the life and element.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And this re-animation of Nature was possible because
the imagination was felt as <em>creative</em> in the full religious
sense of the word. It had itself assisted in creating
the natural forms which the senses were now contemplating.
It had moved upon the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
waters. For it was “the repetition in the finite mind
of the eternal act of creation”—the Word made
human.</p>

<p>In tracing the semantic history of important words
like these, we must not forget that nine-tenths of the
words comprising the vocabulary of a civilized nation
are never used by more than about one-tenth of the
population; while of the remaining tithe nine-tenths
of those who use them are commonly aware of about
one-tenth of their meanings. Nevertheless it is just
by following those meanings up to the high-water
mark which they have reached in a few eager minds
that we can observe what may fairly be called changes
in the general consciousness. It is true that the new
meanings must filter through a graduated hierarchy
of imaginative literature, literary journalism, reviews,
sermons, journalism, popular novels, advertisements,
and cinema captions before what is left of them reaches
the general public; but the amount that is left,
and the spell which is accordingly exerted on the
many, depends on how far they have first been carried
by the few.</p>

<p>Thus, to take one example, the extraordinary load
of meaning often borne by the word <i>dream</i>, in phrases
like <i>dreamland</i>, <i>my dreams</i>, <i>the land of my dreams</i>, ...
is no doubt traceable ultimately to the use of this
word by the great Romantics. When Shelley wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent20">Through the cold mass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of marble and of colour his<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> dreams pass....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">He hath awakened from the dream of life....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he was also, we might say, writing the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
of a good many twentieth-century drawing-room
ballads. But to feel the <em>full</em> weight of the semantic
burden which this little word can be made to bear
in our time we must turn to a modern philosopher,
Mr. Santayana, who has brought the use of it to a
fine art. “The <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>,” he writes, “marks
high noon in that long day-dream of which Plato’s
<cite>Dialogues</cite> mark the beginning....”</p>

<p>Others to-day are fascinated by their <em>dreams</em>, because
they regard them as messengers from that mysterious
inner world in which, like the Christians of old, they are
beginning to divine depths hitherto unimagined. They
feel “forces” at work there which they are tempted
to personify in terms of ancient myth—<i>Ahriman</i>,
<i>Lucifer</i>, <i>Oedipus</i>, <i>Psyche</i>, and the like. But outside
the significant adjective <i>sub-conscious</i>, which has
almost certainly come to stay, the effect which such
tendencies may have on the English language remains
a tale to be told a hundred years hence. The numerous
secondary implications unfolding within <i>dream</i>, however,
its popularity, and its obvious power of suggesting
images, must interest us as further symptoms of a
now almost universal consciousness of at any rate
the existence of such an “inner” world. In some
lines written as a preface to the <cite>Recluse</cite>—the long,
unfinished philosophical poem of which the <cite>Prelude</cite>
and the <cite>Excursion</cite> were to form parts—Wordsworth
has described the holy awe which he, for one, entertained
as he realized that he must now set out to
explore this world:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent20">Urania, I shall need</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy guidance, or a greater Muse, if such</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Descend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep—and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To which the heaven of heavens is but a veil.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">All strength—all terror, single or in bands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That ever was put forth in personal form—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jehovah—with his thunder, and the choir</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of shouting Angels, and the empyreal thrones,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pass them unalarmed. Not Chaos, not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The darkest pit of lowest Erebus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor aught of blinder vacancy, scooped out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By help of dreams—can breed such fear and awe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As fall upon us often when we look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into our Minds, into the Mind of Man—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My haunt, and the main region of my song.</div>

<h2 class="p2 nobreak" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY">BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">The immense debt which the foregoing pages owe
to the <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>—now practically
complete—is, I hope, too obvious from the text
to need further emphasis. Without access to that
unrivalled monument of imaginative scholarship a
great deal of the first part, and nearly all the second
part, of this book could never have been even
attempted. Readers who wish to study history in
English words for themselves should lose no opportunity
of consulting its fascinating volumes. And in
case the fear of wearisome repetition has induced me
to mislead, I should like to take advantage of this
opening to point out that the <cite>O.E.D.</cite> is the authority for
practically all the English etymological and semantic
material on which my book is based. For example,
the incautious but conveniently brief statement that
such a word “was first used by” Chaucer or “first
appeared in” the fourteenth century must be regarded
as the abbreviated form of a longer statement to the
effect that the earliest illustrative quotation given in
the <cite>O.E.D.</cite> under the heading of the word in question
is drawn from Chaucer or from a book written during
that century.</p>

<p>On the subject as a whole—history, and the outlook
of men upon the world, as they are embodied in the
histories of words—comparatively few people seem to
have written in English. Trench led the way with his
little book <cite>On the Study of Words</cite>, which is interesting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
both for itself and because the Archbishop was the first
to attach as much or more importance to the semantic
than to the etymological side of his subject, being, in
fact, himself the originator of the <cite>Oxford Dictionary</cite>.
Max Müller’s numerous essays and writings are fresh
and keen and full of interest. The material adduced
by both these writers should always be verified by
reference to the <cite>Dictionary</cite>.</p>

<p>I do not know if anyone has hitherto attempted
to treat the subject chronologically and systematically,
apart from one solitary English writer, Mr. Pearsall
Smith. To his invaluable little book, <cite>The English
Language</cite> (Home University Library), I am indebted
throughout, not only for very much of my material, but
also for many extremely fruitful suggestions as to the
best way of dealing with it. I have also made extensive
use of two essays (“English Words Abroad” and
“Four Romantic Words”), printed in <cite>Words and
Idioms</cite> (Constable), of which, as of <cite>The English Language</cite>,
it would, in my opinion, be very difficult to
speak too highly, partly because of the imaginative
treatment of the material and partly because of its
solid background of careful scholarship and wide
reading. It is a great pleasure to acknowledge here
the more direct and personal help which I have been
fortunate enough to receive from time to time from
this distinguished writer.</p>

<p>For the rest, I have attempted to skim over such
a wide area that a full bibliography is impossible.
As an introduction to a closer study of the English
language, the late Henry Bradley’s <cite>The Making of
English</cite> is practically indispensable. Skeat’s <cite>Etymological
Dictionary</cite> and <cite>Concise Etymological Dictionary</cite>
(of which it is important to get the latest editions),
and Weekly’s <cite>Etymological Dictionary of Modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
English</cite> are extremely useful works of reference, while
for those who wish to acquire some sort of <em>feeling</em> for
the relationship between apparently dissimilar Aryan
words, such as <i>wheel</i> and ‘kuklos’, <i>brother</i> and ‘frater’,
Skeat’s <cite>Primer of Classical and English Philology</cite>
(Clarendon Press) is inexpensive, brief, and to the
point.</p>

<p>In conclusion, out of the very large number of books
which I have looked into, I append a list of a few
which, either in whole or in part, seem to have proved
especially useful for my particular purpose. But before
laying down my pencil I must say a word on the
somewhat sweeping title given to the second part of
this book. The choice lay between an accurate and
unwieldy title and a brief but inaccurate one. I
chose the latter evil, and the result, I believe, is at
any rate less misleading than a limiting phrase such
as <i>The English Outlook</i> would have been.</p>

<p>It remains to add that such efficiency and precision
as this little volume may possess have been increased
by the kindness of my wife, who assisted me in the
irksome task of indexing it, and of my father, who
undertook the equally exacting business of reading
the sheets.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> There is as yet no satisfactory word in English to express quite
what is meant. The German ‘<span lang="de">Weltanschauung</span>’ (world-outlook)
is nearer to it. If, however, the word <i>consciousness</i> is taken not
simply in its finite sense, as ‘the opposite of unconsciousness’,
but rather as including a man’s whole awareness of his environment,
the sum total of his intellectual and emotional experiences as an
individual, perhaps it may serve.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> Like <i>consciousness</i>, this word must be taken here in its very
widest, metaphorical sense, as of a human ego “looking out” upon
the world through the windows of memory, recognition, the senses,
etc., and of the cosmos which it “sees” through those windows.
It is obvious that the <em>outlook</em> of every individual will be slightly
different from that of every other, also that there will be a great
difference between the average <em>outlook</em> of broad contemporary
classes, such, for instance, as learned and ignorant, artist and
scientist, agnostic and Roman Catholic. The widest gulf of all is
likely to be that between the average outlooks of different historical
periods, and this will be increased if we are dealing with different
races—such as, for example, ancient Egyptians and modern
Americans—for in this case the dissimilarity will extend over
nearly every experience of which the human <em>outlook</em> is composed.</p>

Freemason’s attempt to depict the proceedings within an Egyptian
Mystery School, and the opera itself is plainly a fanciful treatment

Papageno when he attempts to sing with the padlock on his lips

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> This word has been used by English writers in various ways—generally
as a synonym for <i>universe</i>. Of late, however, there has
perhaps been a slight tendency to differentiate it by making it
mean the universe <i>as seen and felt by a particular individual or body
of individuals</i>—‘the cosmos of our experience.’ This distinction
appears to be a fruitful one and will be adopted here. As the words
are used in this book, therefore, we should say that there is only one
<i>universe</i>, but as many <i>cosmoses</i> as there are individuals. In this
way the word <i>cosmos</i> becomes a sort of tool with which we can
detach, and objectify for the purpose of inspection, the purely
subjective <i>consciousness</i> or <i>outlook</i> (see <a href="#Page_72">pp. 72</a> and <a href="#Page_73">73</a>, notes).</p>

<i>potential</i> as the opposite of <i>actual</i>, is now practically a synonym for

Christians to describe the secret murderers sent out by the Old
Man of the Mountains against their leaders, because they used to
intoxicate themselves with hashish before the interview. <i>Hazard</i>—originally
a game played with dice—has been traced to Asart, the
name of a castle in Palestine, during the siege of which it is said to

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">[42]</a> To the ordinary, untrained imagination. Philosophers and
scientists, however, have continued to boggle at this notion of
action at a distance. Thus Leibnitz, shortly after Newton published
his discovery: “’Tis also a supernatural thing that bodies
should <i>attract</i> one another at a distance without any intermediate
means.” And Huxley in 1886, on the terms <i>atom</i> and <i>force</i>: “As
real entities, having an objective existence, an indivisible particle
which nevertheless occupies space is surely inconceivable; And
with respect to the operation of that atom, where it is not, by the
aid of a ‘force’ resident in nothingness, I am as little able to
imagine it as I fancy anyone else is.” Hence the invention of a
hypothetical <i>ether</i>, in order that space might be supposed filled
with a continuum of infinitely attenuated matter (<a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>). In the
world of scientific theory the question of action at a distance is
still, so it seems, an appetizing bone of contention.</p>
